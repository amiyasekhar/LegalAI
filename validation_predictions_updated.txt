In an effort to resolve informally and amicably any dispute or controversy which might arise between the parties with respect to this Agreement, without first resorting to any third party or tribunal for resolution, the parties shall first endeavor to resolve the matter through direct discussions and negotiations. If the matter cannot be settled, it shall be referred by each party to a responsible officer of each Alcoa and Camargo Corrêa. If the two officers are unable to resolve the matter within 30 days of its referral, the matter will be referred to the Chief Executive Officers of Alcoa and Camargo Corrêa. If settlement is not thereafter reached through their efforts within an additional 30 days, or such longer time period as they may agree, then either party may initiate arbitration proceedings to resolve the matter. Any such dispute, controversy or claim in connection with this Agreement, including its validity, interpretation, application, scope, enforceability, performance, breach and termination, shall be resolved exclusively and finally by arbitration, to the exclusion of the courts. Notice of arbitration shall be deemed proper if made in accordance with Section 7.6 of this Agreement. If the parties fail to agree in writing on the place where the arbitration is to be conducted, such arbitration shall be held in New York, New York, United States of America. Arbitration shall be conducted in English, pursuant to International Chamber of Commerce (“ICC”) Arbitration Rules in force at the time of the arbitration, by a panel of three arbitrators who are fluent in the English language and who are skilled in the legal and business aspects of the subject matter of this Agreement. The arbitrators shall be appointed in accordance with ICC Rules. Any monetary award made pursuant to such arbitration shall be calculated and paid exclusively in Dollars. Judgment upon the award rendered may be entered in any court having jurisdiction, or an application may be made to any court for a judicial acceptance of the award and an order of enforcement, as the case may be. Each of the parties hereby irrevocably and unconditionally submits, for itself and its property, to the nonexclusive jurisdiction of any Federal court of the United States of America sitting in New York City and any appellate court from thereof for recognition or enforcement of any such judgment. Each party hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives any objection (including any defense of inconvenient forum) which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of such venue, and each party irrevocably consents to service of process in the manner provided for notices in Section 7.6.

For any dispute or claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement, or breach hereof, either Buyer or Seller may demand arbitration of the matter unless the amount of the Loss is at issue in pending litigation with a third Person, in which event arbitration shall not be commenced until such amount is ascertained or both Parties agree to arbitration in accordance with this Section. Any arbitration initiated pursuant to this Section shall be conducted by three arbitrators. Buyer and Seller shall each select one arbitrator, and the two arbitrators so selected shall select a third arbitrator, each of which arbitrators shall be independent. The arbitrators shall set a limited time period and establish procedures designed to reduce the cost and time for discovery while allowing the Parties an opportunity, adequate in the sole judgment of the arbitrators, to discover relevant information from the opposing Parties about the subject matter of the dispute. The arbitrators shall rule upon motions to compel or limit discovery and shall have the authority to impose sanctions, including attorneys fees and costs, to the same extent as a court of competent law or equity, should the arbitrators determine that discovery was sought without substantial justification or that discovery was refused or objected to without substantial justification. The decision of a majority of the three arbitrators as to the validity and amount of any claim in a Claim Notice shall be binding and conclusive upon the Parties to this Agreement. Such decision shall be written and shall be supported by written findings of fact and conclusions which shall set forth the award, judgment, decree or order awarded by the arbitrators. Judgment upon any award rendered by the arbitrators may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. Any such arbitration shall be held in Santa Clara County, California under the rules then in effect of the American Arbitration Association. In any arbitration conducted pursuant to this Section, each Party shall pay its own expenses, and the fees of each arbitrator shall be paid one-half by Seller and one-half by Buyer.

Clause Text:
Promptly after receipt by either party hereto seeking indemnification pursuant to Section 7.2 (an "Indemnified Party") of written notice of any investigation, claim, proceeding or other action in respect of which indemnification is being sought (each, a "Claim"), the Indemnified Party promptly shall notify the party against whom indemnification pursuant to Section 7.2 is being sought (the "Indemnifying Party") of the commencement thereof; but the omission to so notify the Indemnifying Party shall not relieve it from any liability that it otherwise may have to the Indemnified Party, except to the extent that the Indemnifying Party is materially prejudiced and forfeits substantive rights and defenses by reason of such failure. In connection with any Claim as to which both the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party are parties, the Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to assume the defense thereof. Notwithstanding the assumption of the defense of any Claim by the Indemnifying Party, the Indemnified Party shall have the right to employ separate legal counsel and to participate in the defense of such Claim, and the Indemnifying Party shall bear the reasonable fees, out-of-pocket costs and expenses of such separate legal counsel to the Indemnified Party if (and only if): (x) the Indemnifying Party shall have agreed to pay such fees, out-of-pocket costs and expenses, (y) the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party reasonably shall have concluded that representation of the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party by the same legal counsel would not be appropriate due to actual or, as reasonably determined by legal counsel to the Indemnified Party, potentially differing interests between such parties in the conduct of the defense of such Claim, or if there may be legal defenses available to the Indemnified Party that are in addition to or disparate from those available to the Indemnifying Party, or (z) the Indemnifying Party shall have failed to employ legal counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party within a reasonable period of time after notice of the commencement of such Claim. If the Indemnified Party employs separate legal counsel in circumstances other than as described in clauses (x), (y) or (z) above, the fees, costs and expenses of such legal counsel shall be borne exclusively by the Indemnified Party. Except as provided above, the Indemnifying Party shall not, in connection with any Claim in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one firm of legal counsel for the Indemnified Party (together with appropriate local counsel). The Indemnifying Party shall not, without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party (which consent shall not unreasonably be withheld), settle or compromise any Claim or consent to the entry of any judgment that does not include an unconditional release of the Indemnified Party from all liabilities with respect to such Claim or judgment.

Clause Text:
If Owners request verification of Contractor’s Costs claimed by Contractor [***] or for any Work performed or provided on a Time and Materials Basis, Owners or Owners’ independent auditor shall examine and audit Contractor’s records and books related to those costs and provide a report to Owners. Owners’ audit right also shall apply to Contractor’s books and records that pertain to any Change Order or to [***]. Such audit will be conducted during business hours and provide each Owner with a reasonable opportunity to verify that all costs and charges have been properly invoiced in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. Owners shall not be entitled to audit any information that would enable Owners to determine the make-up of any lump sum, or any fixed or established amounts, rates or multipliers permitted under this Agreement [***]; provided, however that Owners shall be permitted such information for the limited purposes of determining [***]. If an audit by the auditor reveals charges to or paid by Owners as charges or fees which are incorrectly charged, then Owners shall be entitled upon demand for a refund from Contractor of such plus interest since the date of payment of the over-charges at a rate equal to the Prime Rate plus one percent (1%). Likewise, if an audit or if an examination by any state or local taxing agency reveals additional Sales Tax to be imposed upon Contractor for under collection of tax from Owners on a taxable sale, then Contractor shall be entitled, upon demand, for a refund from Owners of all such amounts actually paid, subject to the following proviso: Contractor acknowledges and agrees that Owners will remit any and all Sales Tax due to the State of Georgia or any taxing jurisdiction thereof directly to the Georgia Department of Revenue (“DOR”) pursuant to a “Direct Pay Permit” issued to Owners by the DOR, which Owners shall also provide to Contractor, thereby relieving Contractor of any obligation to collect and remit such Sales Tax in Georgia. In the event that the DOR or any other Georgia taxing authority attempts to collect Sales Tax from Contractor with respect to any taxable sale to Owners, Contractor shall notify Owners of same and Owners shall provide to Contractor and the Georgia taxing jurisdiction evidence of payment of such Sales Tax pursuant to the Direct Pay Permit. Should such taxing jurisdiction continue to pursue the collection of such Sales Tax from Contractor notwithstanding the receipt of evidence from Owners that such Sales Tax has been paid, Owners shall have right, but not the obligation, to contest Contractor’s liability for such Sales Tax on Contractor’s behalf in any administrative or judicial proceedings that may arise with respect thereto. Notwithstanding anything in this Section to the contrary, Owners shall not be restricted from any audit rights that they are required to have in order to comply with applicable Laws, including without limitation the requirements of the NRC.

Clause Text:
The Borrower hereby indemnifies each of the Lenders against any loss or expense which may arise or be attributable to each Lender's obtaining, liquidating or employing deposits or other funds acquired to effect, fund or maintain any Revolving Credit Loan (a) as a consequence of any failure by the Borrower to make any payment when due of any amount due hereunder in connection with a LIBOR Rate Loan, (b) due to any failure of the Borrower to borrow on a date specified therefor in a Notice of Revolving Credit Borrowing or Notice of Continuation/Conversion or (c) due to any payment, prepayment or conversion of any LIBOR Rate Loan on a date other than the last day of the Interest Period therefor. The amount of such loss, cost or expense to any Lender shall be deemed to equal an amount determined by such Lender to be the excess, if any, of (i) the amount of interest which would have accrued on the principal amount of such Loan had such event not occurred, at the LIBOR Rate that would have been applicable to such Loan, for the period from the date of such event to the last day of the then current Interest Period therefor (or, in the case of a failure to borrow, convert or continue, for the period that would have been the Interest Period for such Loan), over (ii) the amount of interest which would accrue on such principal amount for such period at the interest rate which such Lender would bid, were it to bid, at the commencement of such period, for Dollar deposits of a comparable amount and period from other banks in the London interbank market; provided that no compensation shall be payable pursuant to the above if the applicable Lender fails to demand compensation for such increased costs within one-hundred eighty (180) days following the date on which such Lender has actual knowledge of the event resulting in such increase. A certificate of such Lender setting forth in reasonable detail the basis for determining such amount or amounts necessary to compensate such Lender shall be forwarded to the Borrower through the Administrative Agent and shall be conclusively presumed to be correct save for manifest error.

All actions necessary to maintain the registration, application or use of the Intellectual Property have been taken by the Seller, and the Seller has not engaged in any conduct or omitted to perform any necessary act, the result of which would invalidate, abandon or otherwise render the Seller's rights to any Intellectual Property unenforceable.

As used in the business of the Seller as currently conducted, none of the Intellectual Property infringes or misappropriates or otherwise violates or has been alleged to infringe, misappropriate or otherwise violate any proprietary rights of any other person or entity, nor is the Seller otherwise in the conduct of its business infringing upon, or alleged to be infringing upon, any proprietary rights of any other person or entity.

To the Company’s knowledge, all material technical information developed by and belonging to the Company or any Subsidiary that has not been patented or published has been kept confidential. To the Company’s knowledge, neither the Company nor any Subsidiary is a party to or bound by any options, licenses or agreements with respect to the Intellectual Property Rights of any other person or entity that are required to be set forth in the Registration Statement, the Pricing Disclosure Package and the Prospectus and are not described therein. The Registration Statement, the Pricing Disclosure Package and the Prospectus contain in all material respects the same description of the matters set forth in the preceding sentence.

This Agreement and all other Contract Documents shall be governed by the laws of the State of Nevada.

Promptly after receipt by either party hereto seeking indemnification pursuant to Section 7.2 (an "Indemnified Party") of written notice of any investigation, claim, proceeding or other action in respect of which indemnification is being sought (each, a "Claim"), the Indemnified Party promptly shall notify the party against whom indemnification pursuant to Section 7.2 is being sought (the "Indemnifying Party") of the commencement thereof; but the omission to so notify the Indemnifying Party shall not relieve it from any liability that it otherwise may have to the Indemnified Party, except to the extent that the Indemnifying Party is materially prejudiced and forfeits substantive rights and defenses by reason of such failure. In connection with any Claim as to which both the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party are parties, the Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to assume the defense thereof. Notwithstanding the assumption of the defense of any Claim by the Indemnifying Party, the Indemnified Party shall have the right to employ separate legal counsel and to participate in the defense of such Claim, and the Indemnifying Party shall bear the reasonable fees, out-of-pocket costs and expenses of such separate legal counsel to the Indemnified Party if (and only if): (x) the Indemnifying Party shall have agreed to pay such fees, out-of-pocket costs and expenses, (y) the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party reasonably shall have concluded that representation of the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party by the same legal counsel would not be appropriate due to actual or, as reasonably determined by legal counsel to the Indemnified Party, potentially differing interests between such parties in the conduct of the defense of such Claim, or if there may be legal defenses available to the Indemnified Party that are in addition to or disparate from those available to the Indemnifying Party, or (z) the Indemnifying Party shall have failed to employ legal counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party within a reasonable period of time after notice of the commencement of such Claim. If the Indemnified Party employs separate legal counsel in circumstances other than as described in clauses (x), (y) or (z) above, the fees, costs and expenses of such legal counsel shall be borne exclusively by the Indemnified Party. Except as provided above, the Indemnifying Party shall not, in connection with any Claim in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one firm of legal counsel for the Indemnified Party (together with appropriate local counsel). The Indemnifying Party shall not, without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party (which consent shall not unreasonably be withheld), settle or compromise any Claim or consent to the entry of any judgment that does not include an unconditional release of the Indemnified Party from all liabilities with respect to such Claim or judgment.

Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section 2.7 of notice of the commencement of any action (including any governmental action), such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against any indemnifying party under this Section 2.7, deliver to the indemnifying party a written notice of the commencement thereof and the indemnifying party shall have the right to participate in and, to the extent the indemnifying party so desires, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly noticed, to assume the defense thereof with counsel mutually satisfactory to the parties; provided , however , that an indemnified party (together with all other indemnified parties which may be represented without conflict by one counsel) shall have the right to retain one separate counsel, with the fees and expenses to be paid by the indemnifying party, if representation of such indemnified party by the counsel retained by the indemnifying party would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing of interests between such indemnified party and any other party represented by such counsel in such proceeding. The failure to deliver written notice to the indemnifying party within a reasonable time of the commencement of any such action, if prejudicial to its ability to defend such action, shall relieve such indemnifying party of liability to the extent so prejudiced to the indemnified party under this Section 2.7, but the omission so to deliver written notice to the indemnifying party will not relieve it of any liability that it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under this Section 2.7.

Clause #954
Clause Text:
In the event of a dispute between the Company and the Managing Member relating to the terms of or performance under this Operating Agreement, either party may, by written notice to the other party, call for mediation of the issue before a mediator to be agreed upon by the parties.  In the event of a dispute between the parties arising out of or relating to the Agreement that is not resolved by mediation, without first attempting to resolve the dispute by mediation, either party may by written notice to the other party, call for arbitration of the issue before a single arbitrator agreed upon by the parties.  In the event a single arbitrator cannot be agreed upon, each party shall appoint an arbitrator from a list provided by the American Arbitration Association (but not a principal of a party) and the two arbitrators thus selected by the parties shall select a third arbitrator.  The arbitrators shall meet as expeditiously as possible to resolve the dispute, and a majority decision of the arbitrators shall be controlling.  While each party is free to select an arbitrator of its own choosing from the list provided by the American Arbitration Association, either party by written notice to the other may require that all arbitrators chosen have sufficient expertise in the subject matter of the arbitration that they would qualify as “expert witnesses” in a judicial proceeding.  The arbitration proceeding shall be held in Minnehaha County, South Dakota, or some other location mutually acceptable to the parties.  The arbitrators shall issue a written opinion setting forth their findings of fact, conclusions of law and decision.  The arbitrators’ decision may be reduced to judgment in a court of law.  The arbitrators so chosen shall conduct the arbitration in accordance with the Rules of the American Arbitration Association as applicable in the State of South Dakota.  The arbitrators shall be governed, in their determinations hereunder, by the intention of the parties as evidenced by the terms of this Operating Agreement.  The Board of Managers and the Managing Member each understand that they will not be able to bring a lawsuit concerning any dispute that may arise that is covered by this arbitration provision, unless it involves a question of constitutional law or civil rights.  Instead, each party agrees to submit disputes to binding impartial arbitration as provided herein and to be bound by the arbitrator’s decision.

Clause Text:
Except for matters involving equitable relief, any controversy or claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement, or the breach thereof, shall be resolved in the following order: (i) by good faith negotiation between representatives of Crown and Metawave who have authority to fully and finally resolve the dispute to commence within ten (10) days of the request of either Party; (ii) in the event that the Parties have not succeeded in negotiating a resolution of the dispute within ten (10) days after the first meeting, then the dispute will be resolved by non-binding mediation to be held in Los Angeles, CA, using a mutually agreed upon non-affiliated neutral Party (or if the Parties are unable to agree upon a mediator, an impartial mediator selected by the American Arbitration Association) having experience with or knowledge in the wireless communications equipment industry, such neutral Party to be chosen within five (5) days after notice by either Party demanding mediation (the costs therefore to be shared equally); and (iii) if within thirty (30) days of the initial demand for mediation by the Parties, the dispute cannot be resolved by mediation, then the dispute will be resolved by binding arbitration administered in Los Angeles, CA by the American Arbitration Association under its Commercial Arbitration Rules, including the Optional Rules for Emergency Measures of Protection, and judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator(s) may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. The Parties agree that they shall pick the arbitrator(s) within five (5) business days of the submission from the American Arbitration Association of proposed arbitrators to the Parties. All discovery in arbitration shall be completed within thirty (30) days after the selection of the arbitrator(s) and the hearing shall be held within thirty (30) days of the completion of discovery. All costs of such arbitration will be shared equally by the Parties with each Party bearing the cost of its own counsel. The Parties commit to expedite the arbitration process and not to delay any portion thereof. The parties agree to abide by and perform any award rendered by the arbitrator(s). A ruling by the arbitrator(s) shall be non-appealable. If either party seeks enforcement of the terms of this Agreement or seeks enforcement of any award rendered by the arbitrator(s), then the prevailing party (designated by the arbitrator(s)) to such proceeding(s) shall be entitled to recover its legal costs and expenses (other than the arbitration costs) from the non-prevailing party, in addition to any other relief to which it may be entitled.

Clause Text:
In consideration of this Agreement, the Employee agrees that, during the Employment Term, and for one year thereafter, the Employee shall not act as a proprietor, investor, director, officer, employee, substantial stockholder, consultant, or partner in any mattress retailer which does not sell Sealy products or with any of the following mattress manufacturing companies or their affiliates: Simmons, Serta, Spring Air, and Kingsdown. The Employee understands that the foregoing restrictions may limit the Employee’s ability to engage in certain business pursuits during the period provided for above, but acknowledges that the Employee will receive sufficiently higher remuneration and other benefits from the Company hereunder than the Employee would otherwise receive to justify such restriction. The Employee acknowledges that the Employee understands the effect of the provisions of this Section 9, and that the Employee has had reasonable time to consider the effect of these provisions, and that the Employee was encouraged to and had an opportunity to consult an attorney with respect to these provisions. The Company and the Employee consider the restrictions contained in this Section 9 to be reasonable and necessary. Nevertheless, if any aspect of these restrictions is found to be unreasonable or otherwise unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, the Parties intend for such restrictions to be modified by such court so as to be reasonable and enforceable and, as so modified by the court, to be fully enforced. In the event of a breach or threatened breach of this Section 9 by the Employee, the Company will be entitled to preliminary and permanent injunctive relief, without bond or security, sufficient to enforce the provisions hereof and the Company will be entitled to pursue such other remedies at law or in equity which it deems appropriate.
