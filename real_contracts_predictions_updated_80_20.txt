Each party will defend, indemnify and hold harmless the other party, its officers, directors, employees, sublicensees, customers and agents from and against any and all losses, liabilities, damages, expenses and costs (including reasonable attorney’s fees) (“Losses”), including Losses resulting from third party claims, demands, suits or proceedings, to the extent arising out of (i) its negligence, intentional misconduct or bad faith, (ii) any breach of its confidentiality obligations under this Agreement, or (iii) an actual material breach of this Agreement or any Statement of Work on the part of the indemnifying party. EVERSANA will defend, indemnify and hold harmless the Client, its officers, directors, employees, sublicensees, customers and agents from and against any and all Losses resulting from or alleging that any of the Work Product or EVERSANA Property provided by EVERSANA under this Agreement infringes or misappropriates any third-party’s Intellectual Property. Each party will notify the other party promptly upon learning of a claim, demand, suit, or proceeding that might give rise to a Loss, and the potentially indemnifying party may control defense and settlement thereof provided it does so diligently, in good faith, and using reasonably experienced counsel with expertise in the relevant field. The Indemnified Party shall give the Indemnifying Party timely written notice and reasonable cooperation and assistance in the defense of any Losses; provided however, that failure of the Indemnified Party to give such notice shall not limit the Indemnified Party’s right to indemnification except in such case where such failure was known to the Indemnified Party and materially and adversely affects the Indemnifying Party’s ability to defend against such Losses. The potentially indemnified party will reasonably cooperate in such defense and/or settlement at the potentially indemnifying party’s request and expense and may participate at its own expense using its own counsel. In no event shall the Indemnified Party be liable for any claims that are compromised or settled in violation of this Section. In the event of a dispute in connection with the validity of this Section (Indemnification), all costs, fees and expenses, including but not limited to attorneys’ fees, shall be allocated as set forth in Section 12 hereof.
Client shall reimburse EVERSANA for all of the out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including, reasonable attorneys’ fees) incurred by EVERSANA in connection with any of the following events or occurrences, except to the extent that such events or occurrences are caused by gross negligence, bad faith or reckless or intentional misconduct by EVERSANA or a breach by EVERSANA of its express obligations contained in this Agreement: (i) any directed inspection, investigation or inquiry by any regulatory authority attributable to Client or its Products or business practices; or (ii) any court or regulatory authority order, subpoena, interrogatory, demand, request for admission or other process of law directed to EVERSANA and specifically attributable to Client or its Products or business practices; or (iii) any request by Client to produce documentation or information, or give testimony or other services in connection with either (i) or (ii) above.
The parties hereto acknowledge that EVERSANA has not had and will not have any role in the manufacture, labeling, or packaging of Products and that, as between the parties, Client shall have the sole liability for any product liability or similar claims (regardless of the legal theory upon which such claims may be brought) with respect to Products.
Accordingly, except to the extent caused by the gross negligence, bad faith or reckless or intentional misconduct by EVERSANA or a breach by EVERSANA of its express material obligations contained in this Agreement, Client indemnifies and agrees to defend and hold EVERSANA and its members, directors, officers, managers, employees and agents (“EVERSANA Indemnitees”), harmless from any and all third-party claims and resulting damages (whether for bodily injury or death, third-party property damage or otherwise), demands, causes of action, losses, judgments, costs and expenses of any nature whatsoever, including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys’ fees (collectively, “Claims”) to the extent caused by or attributable to:
(i) Any defect(s) in the manufacture of any Product, inherent safety risks of any Product or dangerous side effects of any Product;
(ii) The manufacturing, labeling, and packaging of any Product;
(iii) Marketing practices of Client, off-label usage of any Product or the promotion of off-label usage, fraud, criminal or civil investigation, inspection or inquiry by or on behalf of any regulatory agency or other entity in connection with any Product, Client, its business or its representatives;
(iv) Any actual or asserted violation of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act or any other Law by virtue of which any Product is alleged or determined to be adulterated, misbranded, mislabeled or otherwise not in full compliance with such law;
(v) Any actual or asserted infringement or violation of any patent, trademark, trade name, copyright or other intellectual or proprietary rights of any third party with respect to any Product or information relating to any such Product (excluding the Work Product or other hardware, software, data, or materials provided by EVERSANA under this Agreement); or
(vi) EVERSANA’s use of or reliance upon any information, documents, direction or instruction provided, supplied or approved by Client or its representatives regarding any Product, Client, or its business.

5. INDEMNIFICATION. Each Service Recipient shall indemnify, reimburse, defend and hold harmless Service Provider, its Affiliates and their respective successors and permitted assigns, together with their respective current and future employees, officers, members, managers, directors, agents and representatives (collectively the “Indemnified Parties”), from and against all losses, costs, damages, injuries, taxes, penalties, interests, expenses, obligations, claims and liabilities (joint or severable) of any kind or nature whatsoever, including for injury, sickness, disease or death to employees or other persons (collectively “Losses”) that are incurred by such Indemnified Parties in connection with, relating to or arising out of (i) the breach of any term or condition of this Agreement, or (ii) the performance of any Services hereunder; provided, however, that Service Recipients shall not be obligated to indemnify, reimburse, defend or hold harmless any Indemnified Party for any Losses incurred by such Indemnified Party in connection with, relating to or arising out of:
   (a) the gross negligence, willful misconduct, bad faith or reckless disregard of such Indemnified Party in the performance of any Services hereunder; or
   (b) fraudulent or dishonest acts of such Indemnified Party with respect to the Service Recipients.
Each Service Recipient’s obligation to indemnify, defend, reimburse and hold the Indemnified Parties harmless shall extend to and include, but not be limited to, claims, demands, judgments, liabilities and expenses resulting from the personal injury, sickness, disease or death of any persons, regardless of whether such Service Recipient has paid the person under the provisions of any workers’ compensation statute or law, or other similar federal or state legislation for the protection of employees.
The rights of any Indemnified Party referred to above are in addition to any rights that such Indemnified Party otherwise has at law or in equity. Without the prior written consent of the Service Recipients, no Indemnified Party may settle, compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment in, or otherwise seek to terminate any, claim, action, proceeding or investigation in respect of which indemnification could be sought hereunder unless (A) such Indemnified Party indemnifies the Service Recipients from any liabilities arising out of such claim, action, proceeding or investigation, (B) such settlement, compromise or consent includes an unconditional release of the Service Recipients and Indemnified Party from all liability arising out of such claim, action, proceeding or investigation and (C) the parties involved agree that the terms of such settlement, compromise or consent remain confidential. In the event that indemnification is provided for under any other agreements between CVR Energy or any of its Affiliates and any of the Service Recipients or any of their Affiliates, and such indemnification is for any particular Losses, then such indemnification (and any limitations thereon) as provided in such other agreement applies as to such particular Losses and will supersede and be in lieu of any indemnification that would otherwise apply to such particular Losses under this Agreement.
In the event that any indemnity provisions of this Agreement are contrary to the law governing this Agreement, then the indemnity obligations applicable hereunder will be construed to be to the fullest extent allowed by applicable law.

   a. Customer may request Services during the Term by (i) executing a statement of work prepared by Equinix (“SOW”), (ii) placing an online order via the Customer Care Website (“Online Order”), or (iii) placing a phone order (“Phone Order”). SOWs, Online Orders and Phone Orders may also be collectively referred to as “Orders”. SOWs will not be effective unless signed by both Parties. Online Orders and Phone Orders do not need to be signed by both Parties to be effective, but they will only be effective if Equinix accepts the Online Order or Phone Order in accordance with Equinix’s then-current ordering procedures or Equinix begins providing the Service ordered in the Online Order or Phone Order. Customer and Equinix may execute multiple Orders under this Agreement and all Orders will be governed by the terms and conditions of this Agreement. Each additional Order will supplement rather than replace the prior Orders, unless otherwise stated by the Parties in writing. If Customer requests a change to an existing Order, Equinix will prepare a change order (“Change Order”) which will be effective when signed by the Parties or when Equinix sends an Order Confirmation. Change Orders will amend existing Orders but will not replace them, unless otherwise agreed to by the Parties in writing. Equinix has no obligation to execute, or to amend, any Order, including any Change Order, with Customer.  
   b. Equinix will provide Customer with an account and password to access the Customer Care Website. Customer is responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of its account and password and for restricting and granting access thereto. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Customer is responsible and liable for all activities that occur under Customer’s account (including all payments owed for any Orders that are placed under Customer’s account), regardless of whether such activities are conducted by Customer, a Sublicensee or any other third party, and regardless of whether such Orders are authorized by Customer. Equinix does not have any obligation to verify that anyone using Customer’s account and password has Customer’s authorization.

3. **Payment Terms and Taxes.**  
   a. Unless otherwise agreed between the Parties in writing, Service Fees for the Services will begin to accrue on the Billing Commencement Date. Equinix will invoice Customer for the Services on a monthly basis (partial months will be billed on a pro rata basis based on a thirty (30) day month) and Customer will pay for the Services in accordance with this Section 3. Customer will pay in full all invoices (excluding Disputed Amounts, subject to a pending dispute) from Equinix within thirty (30) days of the invoice. Any past due amounts owed (excluding Disputed Amounts, subject to a pending dispute) by Customer will accrue interest at the lesser of one and a half percent (1.5%) per month or the highest rate permitted by applicable law. Unless otherwise stated in the Order, all invoices will be paid in U.S. Dollars. Unless otherwise agreed to by the parties in writing, Equinix will invoice in advance each month for all recurring Services (except for the first partial month, if applicable, of recurring Services).  
   b. The Service Fees for Services ordered through SOWs will be listed on the SOWs. For Online Orders and Phone Orders, the Service Fees will be Equinix’s then-current list price for such Services, unless otherwise agreed to by the Parties in writing or in an Order Confirmation. Customer agrees to pay for each Service for the duration of the applicable Order. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, upon sixty (60) days prior notice to Customer, Equinix may in its reasonable discretion change the rates and fees for any and all Services at any time(s) after twelve (12) months from the effective date of the applicable SOW for such Service, unless otherwise agreed to by the Parties in writing. For purposes of the prior sentence, in the case of each Online Order and Phone Order, the “applicable SOW” shall mean the SOW which contains the Licensed Space in which the Services ordered on such Online Order or Phone Order are installed.  
   c. Equinix is not responsible or in any way liable for any Taxes or third-party charges related to the activities, or the ownership or operation of the equipment (including Customer’s Equipment), of any of the following: Customer’s Authorized Persons, Accompanying Persons, and Associated Entities, at any IBX Center, or attributable to, any IBX Center. Without limiting the foregoing, Customer will be responsible for paying any and all Taxes separately imposed, levied or assessed against Customer by, and preparing and filing any necessary return with, any governmental, quasi-governmental or tax authorities by the date such payments and returns are due. In no event will Customer’s Equipment be construed to be fixtures. Service Fees are exclusive of any Taxes imposed on Service Fees. Customer will be responsible for paying any Taxes imposed on Service Fees at the same time it pays the Service Fees. Customer will be responsible for timely paying in full all Taxes.  
   d. In the event that Customer’s account is past due (excluding Disputed Amounts, subject to a pending dispute) two (2) or more times in any twelve (12) month period, Equinix may charge Customer a deposit equal to one (1) month of the recurring Service Fees that are billable at the time such deposit is charged (the “Deposit”). The Deposit shall be held by Equinix and returned or credited to Customer, without interest, upon termination of this Agreement if Customer so requests in writing at that time. In the event of breach of this Agreement by Customer, Equinix shall, without limiting its remedies otherwise available, have the right to apply the Deposit to the damages suffered by Equinix as a result of such breach.  
   e. If Customer wishes to dispute a charge listed on an Equinix invoice to Customer (a “Disputed Amount”), Customer must submit a written dispute notice that includes reasonably sufficient supporting documentation within ninety (90) days of receipt of the initial invoice on which the Disputed Amount appears. If Customer does not submit such written dispute notice and reasonably sufficient supporting documentation to Equinix within such ninety (90) day period, then notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Customer waives all rights to dispute such Disputed Amount and to file a claim of any kind relating to such Disputed Amount (and Customer also waives all rights to otherwise claim that it does not owe such Disputed Amount or to seek any set-offs or reimbursements or other amounts of any kind based upon or relating to such Disputed Amount).

   b. Unless otherwise expressly provided in an Order (and then only to the extent otherwise expressly provided therein), Customer will be responsible for configuring, providing, placing, installing, upgrading, adding, maintaining, repairing, and operating Customer’s Equipment, which actions Customer may engage in only to the extent permitted by, and subject to, the terms and conditions of this Agreement. Customer represents, warrants and covenants that it has obtained and will maintain throughout the Term the legal right and authority (including regulatory consents) to operate, configure, provide, place, install, upgrade, add, maintain and repair Customer’s Equipment as contemplated by this Agreement. Without limiting the foregoing, Customer will obtain and maintain throughout the Term consent from Customer’s subcontractors, third party providers, vendors, Sublicensees and any other parties necessary to permit Equinix (including any contractors or others acting at Equinix’s request) to access Customer’s Equipment to provide the Services. Except as set forth in Section 5 (which is further limited by Section 6), Equinix will not have any responsibility for any loss or damage to Customer’s Equipment.  
   c. Equinix and Customer will comply with the Policies, which have been furnished to customer and which are incorporated by reference into this Agreement. Subject to Customer’s termination right in Section 8(c). Equinix may modify the Policies at any time(s), and any modification by Equinix to the Policies will be effective upon notice to Customer, except modifications to the Shipping Policies, which will be effective immediately upon being made.  
   d. Customer will be responsible and liable for all acts or omissions of Customer’s Authorized Persons, Accompanying Persons, and Associated Entities, and all such acts or omissions will be attributed to Customer for all purposes under this Agreement (to the same extent as if Customer had committed the act or omission), including for purposes of determining responsibility, liability and indemnification obligations.  
   e. Customer will not file a mechanic’s lien or similar lien on the Licensed Space or IBX Centers, and Customer will be responsible for any mechanic’s lien or similar lien filed by any Authorized Person, Accompanying Person or Associated Entity. Without limiting the foregoing, in the event any such lien is filed, Customer will be responsible for the immediate satisfaction, payment or bonding of any such lien.

   b.

   c. Through counsel of its own choosing, the indemnified Party has the right to participate in (but not control the defense of) any proceeding in which it is being indemnified under this Agreement, but in such event the indemnified Party will be solely responsible for paying the legal fees and expenses for its own counsel. The indemnifying Party will, however, continue to be solely responsible for all other expenses relating to the action, including the legal fees and expenses of the counsel it selects to defend the claims. The indemnifying Party shall not take any action, which unreasonably exposes the indemnified Party to a risk of damages, which would not be covered by such indemnity, and may not settle any matter without the prior written consent of the indemnified Party, which shall not be unreasonably withheld.

If the breach (other than where Customer has failed to pay Service Fees owed) cannot be cured within thirty (30) days, the breaching Party shall be given a reasonable period of time, but not to exceed sixty (60) days, to cure the breach, provided that the breaching Party acts promptly and diligently to cure such breach. Equinix may also terminate this Agreement if (i) it exercises any of its rights under Section 8(b) three (3) or more times during any twelve (12) month period; (ii) Customer’s breach referenced in Section 8(b) (ii) or (iii) continues for at least ten (10) days after Customer’s receipt of written notice from Equinix, or (iii) Customer liquidates, ceases to do business, or becomes insolvent. Notwithstanding anything in this Section 8(a) to the contrary, except where Customer has failed to timely cure a monetary breach, if Customer has Licensed Space in more than one IBX Center, and a Party fails to timely cure a material breach as to fewer than all such IBX Centers, then the non-breaching Party may only terminate the Orders for Services in the IBX Center(s) where the material breach has not been timely cured, and this Agreement and all other Orders will remain in full force and effect as to all other IBX Centers.  
   b. Equinix may suspend the provision of Services, including discontinuing the supply of power and denying access to the IBX Center, if (i) Customer fails to cure any monetary breach of this Agreement (e.g. fails to pay any amounts owed) within ten (10) days of notice of the same (or within five (5) days of notice of the same in the event Customer’s account is past due on two (2) or more occasions during a six (6) month period); (ii) Customer breaches any provision of this Agreement that in Equinix’s reasonable judgment interferes with Equinix’s operation or maintenance of the IBX Center or with one or more of its other customer’s use thereof, and Customer fails to cure such breach within one (1) hour of being notified (either by fax, e-mail or phone call, at the option of Equinix as to which form of notification) of the same; or (iii) Customer breaches any provision of this Agreement that in Equinix’s reasonable judgment has the potential to interfere with Equinix’s operation or maintenance of the IBX Center or with one or more of its other customers’ use thereof, and Customer fails to cure such breach within forty-eight (48) hours of being notified (either by fax, e-mail or phone call, at the option of Equinix as to which form of notification) of the same. If Equinix suspends a Service pursuant to this Section 8(b), unless Equinix has subsequently terminated this Agreement as permitted under this Agreement, Equinix will resume the discontinued Service within twenty-four (24) hours after it is reasonably satisfied that Customer has cured the breach (es) which gave rise to the suspension, and Equinix may charge a reinstatement fee equal to the direct out-of-pocket expenses incurred by Equinix to discontinue and to then resume the Service.  
   c. Equinix or Customer may terminate this Agreement as to any affected Licensed Space or IBX Center if any portion of the IBX Center in which the affected Licensed Space is located becomes subject to a condemnation proceeding or is condemned, Equinix’s possession is otherwise terminated or abated, or Equinix cannot provide Customer with access to the affected Licensed Space as contemplated herein for a period exceeding thirty (30) days. Customer may terminate this Agreement as to a Licensed Space if Equinix modifies the Policies in a way that materially adversely affects Customer’s use of the Services in such Licensed Space, but only if Customer provides written notification that it wishes to terminate this Agreement within thirty (30) days after Customer received notification of such changes in the Policies.  
   d. Upon expiration or termination of this Agreement, or an Order (or any portion thereof), all rights of Customer with respect to the Licensed Space (or the affected portion thereof) (“Terminated Space”), will terminate, and Customer will immediately remove all of Customer’s Equipment and other tangible items of any kind belonging to Customer, Customer’s Authorized Persons, Accompanying Persons and/or Associated Entities located in such Terminated Space, but not any wiring, cable or other equipment or property owned, leased or licensed by Equinix. If Customer fails to remove any such property (including Customer’s Equipment) in accordance with this Section 8(d), Equinix will be entitled to pursue all available legal remedies against Customer, including (i) immediately removing any or all such property and storing it at Customer’s expense at an on-site or off-site location; (ii) shipping such property to the address set forth at the end of this Agreement at Customer’s risk and expense; or (iii) liquidating such property in any commercially reasonable manner and charging Customer for all costs associated with the liquidation if Equinix provides thirty (30) days’ prior notice to Customer. If Customers account is past due (excluding Disputed Amounts, subject to a pending dispute), including during the time after this Agreement or any Order or portion thereof expires or is terminated then, notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Customer may not remove any of Customer’s Equipment from an IBX Center and hereby waives its right to do so. Additionally, Equinix may (i) immediately remove any or all such property and store it at Customer’s expense at an on-site or off-site location until Customer pays all amounts owed to Equinix and then retrieves the property, or (ii) liquidate such property in any commercially reasonable manner and charge Customer for all costs associated with the liquidation and retain from the liquidation all amounts necessary to pay Equinix the past due amounts if Equinix provides thirty (30) days’ prior notice to Customer and Customer fails to pay all such amounts.  
   e. While Customer has no right to use the Services provided under an Order after the end of the term of such Order, if Customer does so, Customer will be obligated to pay for such Services pursuant to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and any such Order, and any such Order will continue in effect for as long as the Services are used by Customer. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in such event, any such Order will be terminable at will by Equinix effective immediately upon notice to Customer. In addition, notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if this Agreement would have otherwise terminated prior to Customer’s cessation of its use of the Services, this Agreement will continue in effect for as long as the Services are used by Customer, but this Agreement will be terminable at will by Equinix effective immediately upon notice to Customer.  
   f. Neither Party will be liable to the other Party for properly terminating this Agreement or any portion thereof in accordance with its terms, but Customer will be liable to Equinix for any amounts owed prior to the effective date of termination. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Equinix has the right to recover from Customer all damages recoverable under law for the period past the end of the Term, if Equinix terminates this Agreement prior to the end of the full Term due to Customer’s material breach.  
   g. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement (including in any Order) to the contrary, under no circumstances will any Order survive the expiration or earlier termination of this Agreement, and under no circumstances will any Order pertaining to an IBX Center survive the termination of this Agreement as to that IBX Center. Equinix will not have any obligation to provide any Services after the expiration or earlier termination of this Agreement, and Equinix will not have any obligation to provide any Services at an IBX Center after the expiration or earlier termination of this Agreement as to such IBX Center.

   d. Construction. Each Party acknowledges and agrees that it has reviewed, and has had an opportunity to have reviewed, this Agreement (including the exhibits and the Policies), and it is the Parties’ intent that this Agreement will not be construed against any Party. The section headings and captions throughout this Agreement are for convenience and reference only, and will not be used to construe this Agreement. If any provision of this Agreement, as applied to any Party or to any circumstance, is adjudged by a court to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, the same will not affect the validity, legality, or enforceability of the portion of the provision, if any, that is not invalid, illegal or unenforceable, the application of such provision in any other circumstances, or the validity, legality, or enforceability of any other provision of this Agreement. All terms and conditions of this Agreement will be deemed enforceable to the fullest extent permissible under applicable law, and, when necessary, the court in any action between the Parties is requested to reform any and all terms or conditions to give them as much effect as possible.  
   e. Survival.

This Agreement will be binding upon and inure to the benefit of all successors and permitted assigns of Equinix and Customer, who will be bound by all of the obligations of their predecessors or assignors. Except as set forth in Exhibit B of this Agreement with respect to sublicensing only, and this Section 9(g) with respect to an assignment of the entire Agreement under the conditions specified above only. Customer will not assign, delegate, transfer or sublicense all or any part of the Licensed Space.  
   b. Force Majeure. Excluding Customer’s obligation to pay amounts owed under this Agreement, including Service Fees, neither Party will be responsible or in any way liable to the other Party, and neither Party will have any termination or other rights, arising out of or relating to any failure by the other Party to perform or any hindrance in the performance of the obligations under this Agreement if such failure or hindrance is caused by events or circumstances beyond such nonperforming Party’s control, including acts of God, war, labor strike, terrorist act, fire, flood, earthquake, any law, order, regulation or other action of any governing authority or agency thereof, or failure of the Internet , (each a “Force Majeure Event”).

   c. Conflicts. All Orders are at all times subject to all of the terms and conditions of this Agreement. In the event of a conflict between the body of this Agreement and an Order, the body of this Agreement will control, unless the body of this Agreement, or the Order in writing, states that the conflicting term in the Order controls. In the event of a conflict between (1) the Policies and (2) either the body of this Agreement or any Order, the body of this Agreement or any Order will control.  
   d. General. Except where otherwise expressly stated herein, and subject to the limitations set forth in Section 6, the rights and remedies provided for herein are cumulative and not exclusive of any rights or remedies that a Party would otherwise have. Each Party recognizes and agrees that the warranty disclaimers and liability and remedy limitations in this Agreement are material bargained for bases of this Agreement and that they have been taken into account and reflected in determining the consideration to be given by each Party under this Agreement and in the decision by each Party to enter into this Agreement. Equinix and Customer are independent contractors and this Agreement will not establish any relationship of partnership, joint venture, employment, franchise or agency between Equinix and Customer. Neither Equinix nor Customer will have the power to bind the other or incur obligations on the other’s behalf without the other’s prior written consent. The Parties agree that there will be no third party beneficiaries to this Agreement, including, but not limited to, any Accompanying Person, Associated Entity (which includes any Sublicensee), Authorized Person, end user, customer or the insurance providers for either Party. No Party’s directors, officers or employees will have any liability to any other Party with respect to this Agreement. Except as may be specifically otherwise consented to in writing by an Affiliate of a Party (and none of the other terms of this Agreement shall be deemed to constitute such consent), no Party’s Affiliates will have any liability to any other Party with respect to this Agreement, including with respect to any Orders. No waiver of any breach of any provision of this Agreement will constitute a waiver of any prior, concurrent or subsequent breach of the same or any other provisions hereof, and no waiver will be effective unless made in writing and signed by an authorized representative of the waiving Party.

7.4 Indemnification Procedures. Any zulily Indemnified Party or Provider Indemnified Party (each an “Indemnified Party”) believing that it is entitled to indemnification under this Agreement will give prompt written notice to Provider or zulily (an “Indemnifying Party”) of the commencement of any Claim for which indemnification may be sought or, if earlier, upon the assertion of any such Claim (it being understood and agreed, however, that the failure of the Indemnified Party to give notice of a Claim as provided in this Section 7.4 will not relieve an Indemnifying Party of its indemnification obligation under this Agreement unless the Indemnifying Party is materially disadvantaged by such delay). Within 30 days after delivery of such notification, the Indemnifying Party will, upon written notice to the Indemnified Party, assume control of the defense of such Claim with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party; provided that the Indemnifying Party has accepted its indemnity and defense obligations without reservation. If the Indemnifying Party has reserved any rights with respect to defense or indemnity, the Indemnified Party will control the defense. If the Indemnifying Party believes that a Claim presented to it for indemnification is one as to which the Indemnified Party is not entitled to indemnification under this Agreement, it will so notify the Indemnified Party on a prompt basis (but in no event later than 30 days after delivery of notification of the Claim). The Indemnified Party may participate in such defense at its own expense; provided that if the Indemnified Party reasonably concludes, based on advice from counsel, that the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party have conflicting interests with respect to such Claim, the Indemnifying Party will be responsible for the reasonable fees and expenses of independent counsel to the Indemnified Party. The Indemnifying Party will keep the Indemnified Party advised of the status of such Claim and the defense thereof and will consider recommendations made by the Indemnified Party with respect thereto. The Indemnified Party will not agree to any settlement of such Claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party. The Indemnifying Party will not agree to any settlement of such Claim or consent to any judgment in respect thereof that does not include a complete and unconditional release of any Indemnified Party from all liability with respect thereto or that imposes any liability or obligation on the Indemnified Party or adversely affects the Indemnified Party without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party.

An act or omission will be deemed within the reasonable control of a Party if committed, omitted, or caused by such Party, or its affiliates or their respective representatives. The Party affected by the other Party’s delay may elect to (a) suspend performance and extend the time for performance for the duration of the Force Majeure event, or (b) cancel all or any part of the unperformed part of this Agreement or applicable SOW.

2. **Term**
   - This Agreement shall commence on the Effective Date and shall continue, unless earlier terminated in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement, for a period of seven (7) years (the “Initial Term”). Unless otherwise provided, the termination or expiration of a Statement of Work shall not automatically terminate this Agreement, but the termination or expiration of this Agreement shall automatically terminate all Statements of Work. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in accordance with Section 26.18 below, any obligation undertaken hereunder by either Party that, by its nature or its terms, is intended to extend beyond the Term shall survive the termination hereof.
   - Should a Party wish to continue this Agreement after the Initial Term or the then existing Term, such Party shall give the other Party a request in writing to renew this Agreement no later than seven (7) months prior to the expiration of Initial Term or the then-existing Term, as the case may be. Upon receipt of such request to extend the Term of the Agreement, the other Party shall have thirty (30) days in which to accept, in writing, such request for extension. A failure to accept such request within the specified period shall be deemed to be a rejection, in which case neither Party shall have any obligation to negotiate any type of extension of the Term of this Agreement. If the other Party accepts an extension request, the Parties will thereafter negotiate in good faith the terms and conditions that will apply during the extended term (each an “Extended Term”) with a goal of reaching mutual agreement at least six (6) months prior to the expiration of the then-existing Term.
   - Each SOW shall set forth the applicable term for the SOW (each, a “SOW Term”), which SOW Term shall continue for the Term of this Agreement unless the Parties mutually agree in writing otherwise, except that all SOWs, unless sooner terminated, shall terminate at the expiration or termination of the Term of this Agreement.
   - Customer may terminate this Agreement, in whole or in part as to any SOW or portion thereof, for convenience and without cause at any time by giving Provider at least * prior written notice designating the termination date (the “Termination for Convenience Effective Date”), in which event this Agreement or the relevant SOW (or portion thereof) shall terminate as if the date so specified were the originally scheduled date of termination. In the event that a purported termination for cause by Customer under Section 22.1 is determined by a competent authority not to be properly a termination for cause, then such termination by Customer shall be deemed to be a termination for convenience with adequate prior notice under this Section 3.3. In the event of a termination by Customer for convenience pursuant to this Section 3.3, then Customer shall pay to Provider a termination fee, for each SOW or portion thereof so terminated under Section 3.3, determined as follows (the “Termination for Convenience Fee”):
   - In the event that the Customer-designated Termination for Convenience Effective Date takes place before the end of * set forth in each SOW or portion thereof so terminated under Section 3.3 for the Service(s) that are the subject of Customer’s termination for convenience notice (the “Terminated Services”) then the Termination for Convenience Fee shall be equal to the amount of fees Customer paid or has become obligated to pay to Provider for those Terminated Services under the Agreement for the * period immediately preceding the Termination for Convenience Effective Date; provided, however, that if Customer has paid or become obligated to pay less than * of fees immediately preceding the Termination for Convenience Effective Date, then the Termination for Convenience Fee shall be equal to the aggregate amount of fees that Customer paid or became obligated to pay to Provider for those Terminated Services as to each * for which fees were paid or became payable for the * after the relevant SS Commencement Date plus a projected amount based on the average * amount of the fees paid or payable for the * during the period when fees were in fact paid for each additional * necessary to bring the total number of * for which the Termination for Convenience Fee is paid to *.
   - The number of * for which the Termination for Convenience Fee described in Section 3.3.1 above shall be payable shall decrease by * and on each successive * of the relevant SS Commencement Date after a Termination for Convenience Effective Date takes place. For example, if a Customer-designated Termination for Convenience Effective Date takes place between the * of the relevant SS Commencement Date, then the Termination for Convenience Fee shall be equal to the amount of fees Customer paid or became obligated to pay to Provider for the Terminated Services under the Agreement during the * immediately preceding the applicable Termination for Convenience Effective Date, and, if the Termination for Convenience Effective Date takes place between the * of the relevant SS Commencement Date, then the Termination for Convenience Fee shall be equal to the amount of fees Customer paid or became obligated to pay to Provider for the Terminated Services under the Agreement during the * immediately preceding the Termination for Convenience Effective Date, with the * reductions to continue in a like manner, except that in no event shall the Termination for Convenience Fee be less than * fees paid or payable by Customer to Provider, irrespective of the Termination for Convenience Effective Date.
   - In the event of a De Facto Termination for Convenience (as such term is defined below) by Customer, Customer shall pay a Termination for Convenience Fee based on when the Termination for Convenience Effective Date takes place as provided in Sections 3.3.1 through 3.3.2 above only for the average * shortfall of those Services or category of Services under a given SOW that are considered to have suffered a De Facto Termination for Convenience (i.e., the volume of Services terminated beyond the * threshold described below). For purposes of this Section 3.3.3, a “De Facto Termination for Convenience” means a sustained decrease over each of * following the SS Commencement Date in the volume of one or more Services under a given SOW for which Customer is obligated to pay (based on the number of transactions available for Provider to perform) that is greater than * of the * average of the same over the * immediately preceding the period of decreased volume. For example, if the * average volume of transactions during months * following the * of the relevant SS Commencement Date is * transactions and the volume of transactions that Customer makes available to Provider to perform during months * is *, respectively, then Customer shall be deemed to have committed a De Facto Termination for Convenience for exceeding the * variance threshold of * transactions (* % of *) for * and shall be obligated to pay Provider a Termination for Convenience Fee equal to * worth of fees associated with the average * shortfall of * transactions. Notwithstanding the foregoing, under no circumstances shall Customer be deemed to have committed a De Facto Termination for Convenience if Provider is otherwise able to redeploy the Provider Personnel who would otherwise have been idled by the shortfall in volume of Services required to perform other Services on behalf of Customer. In addition, for purposes of clarification and to avoid any misunderstanding, any portion of a Service for which Customer is obligated to pay (even if such Service is not utilized) shall not constitute a shortfall and applied in determining whether the * variance threshold has been exceeded or the amount of the Termination for Convenience Fee for a De Facto Termination for Convenience.
   - Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 3.3, in the event that in any * during the Initial Term, Customer demands, and Provider meets such demand for, a Major Increase (as such Term is defined below) in Services, then the formula for determining the applicable Termination for Convenience Fee shall “reset” and revert to the amount specified in Section 3.3.1, as may be subsequently reduced by * fees for the Terminated Service each year thereafter as provided in Section 3.3.2. For purposes of this Section 3.3.4, a “Major Increase” means a sustained increase in the volume of a Service demanded by Customer after the relevant SS Commencement Date during each of * that is greater than * of the * average over the * immediately preceding the period of increased volume, which increase requires Provider to incur additional capital costs and/or enter into additional binding commitments in order to meet Customer’s demands that, in aggregate, exceed by more than * the pre-existing costs or commitments incurred by Provider immediately prior to Customer’s demand for such Major Increase.

3. **Services**
   - Provider will provide to Customer, and Customer will receive from Provider, the Services specified in this Agreement and the Statements of Work.
   - The Services will be implemented and will commence in accordance with the terms set forth on Schedule 4.2 attached hereto and the applicable SOW.
   - If any services, functions or responsibilities not specifically described in this Agreement are required for the proper performance and provision of the Services, they shall be deemed to be implied by and included within the scope of the Services to the same extent and in the same manner as if specifically described in this Agreement; provided, however, if such Implied Services will cause Provider to incur a Significant Cost Increase, then Provider shall be entitled to submit a written request to the JSC and/or the Governance Board for Customer to provide additional compensation to Provider for such additional costs. Failure by Provider to submit such written request prior to its incurring such additional costs shall constitute a waiver by Provider of its right to seek additional compensation therefor. If the JSC and the Governance Board fail to agree on the resolution of such request, then it may be submitted to dispute resolution in accordance with Article 24 of this Agreement.
   - Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement, Provider shall be responsible for providing all of the resources necessary to provide the Services, including, without limitation, facilities, personnel, software and equipment. In this regard, Provider shall maintain the Equipment and Software used to provide the Services, including (a) maintaining Equipment in good operating condition; (b) undertaking repairs and preventive maintenance on Equipment in accordance with the applicable Equipment manufacturer’s recommendations; and (c) performing Software maintenance, other than with respect to Customer Software maintained by Customer, in accordance with the applicable Software vendor’s documentation and recommendations. Further, Provider agrees to maintain the compatibility of the Equipment, Provider Software, Licensed Software, and other technologies used by Provider in performing the Services (and for which Provider is responsible) with those used by Customer in order for Provider to provide, and Customer to utilize, the Services.
   - Either Party may request a change in or addition to the scope, processes, service levels, service recipients, implementation plan or other changes to a SOW (each, a “Change”), but except as provided in Section 4.5.3, no Change shall be effective and binding unless such Change has been documented in a written change of control document and signed by an Authorized Representative of each Party (each, a “Change Order”). Each Change Order shall be substantially in the form contained in Schedule 4.5 hereto, depending on the nature of the Change. If either Party desires to propose a Change, such Party shall deliver to the relevant Account Manager of the other Party a change request in writing, describing the Change(s) proposed. The Party receiving the request shall respond within ten (10) days following its receipt thereof. If the receiving Party is amenable to the change request, it shall notify the requesting Party, and the requesting Party shall submit a Change Order in draft form for the consideration and approval of the other Party. A Change Order shall include, among other items as appropriate, an estimate of additional or reduced charges to Customer, if applicable, any additional equipment or software or other material required to implement the Change and any expected impact on the project schedule or service-levels under the applicable SOW. Upon execution, including signature by an Authorized Representative of each Party, the Change Order shall become effective and the applicable SOW shall be deemed to have been amended by the Change Order. If the Parties are unable to agree on a Change, then the issue may be referred by the requesting Party to the JSC for resolution.
   - Without limiting the generality of Section 4.5.1 above, the Change Order procedures provided in Section 4.5.1 shall also apply to (i) any requested modification, amendment or alteration to any Administrative Manual practice or procedure that does not qualify as a Minor Administrative Manual Practice or Procedure, (ii) any acknowledgement of the achievement of a SOW milestone event (e.g. the RU Commencement Date and the SS Commencement Date) and (iii) any acknowledgement of the occurrence of an operational event that results in the assessment of a SLA Credit or SLA Bonus, as the case may be, or relieves either Party of its obligations hereunder such as a Relief Event for a Force Majeure Event.
   - Any changes to the legal, regulatory or Payor contract requirements that Provider is required to meet pursuant to the terms of this Agreement shall not be dependent on the execution and approval of a Change Order and shall be effective upon the date of receipt by Provider of written notice thereof signed by an Authorized Representative of Customer, unless such written notice provides for a later effective date; provided that such changes shall still be reviewed and memorialized by the JSC in accordance with the Change Order procedures set forth in Section 4.5.1 above.
   - Any requested modification, amendment or alteration to any term of this Agreement shall be subject to the terms set forth in Section 26.15 below.
   - Notwithstanding Sections 4.5.1 and 4.5.2 above, the Parties’ designated Account Managers may jointly recommend approval of modifications, amendments or alterations to Minor Administrative Manual Practices or Procedures, which recommendations, if adopted, will take immediate effect; provided, however, that such modifications, amendments or alterations cannot and shall not amend or waive any provision of this Agreement or any portion hereof and the effectiveness of such modifications, amendments or alterations may be suspended or nullified by the JSC at any time. For purposes of this Section 4.5, a “Minor Administrative Manual Practice or Procedure” change shall mean a change that does not (i) significantly alter the existing work flow currently in process (i.e. the change does not have any impact on the productivity and average handling time of the process), (ii) alter existing technology currently deployed for the process, and (iii) have any impact on the number of resources (agents and/ or supervisors) required to run the process after the change—including additional resources that may be required to manage any associated regulatory or compliance related requirements that may be a result of such change. In addition, for the sake of clarity, operationally, a Minor Administrative Manual Practice or Procedure change should result in simple dissemination of information to Provider Personnel by either the supervisors and/ or trainers on the process floor, and should not require more than one (1) hour of additional training of such Provider Personnel.
   - For the avoidance of doubt, as noted in Section 4.5.2 above, any requested modification, amendment or alteration to any Administrative Manual practice or procedure other than as specified in Section 4.5.3 that does not qualify as a Minor Administrative Manual Practice or Procedure shall be required to follow the Change Order procedures set forth in this Section 4.5 and memorialized using the Change Order forms set out in Schedule 4.5 hereto.
   - As of the Effective Date, Provider shall provide the Services to Customer, to Customer’s Affiliates, and on Customer’s behalf to those entities to whom and under circumstances similar to those under which services similar to the Services were being provided immediately prior to the Effective Date (collectively “Service Recipients”); provided, however, that any Services provided to Customer’s Affiliates or entities designated by Customer shall be pursuant to a separate SOW that takes into account the additional costs, if any, associated with the provision of the Services to such third parties. At Customer’s option, Provider shall also perform the Services for the following, which, during such extended period of time as follows, shall be deemed to be “Service Recipients”, provided that such extended period shall not continue beyond the Term of this Agreement: (i) an entity which is an Affiliate of Customer shall continue to receive the Services for up to * (and longer if agreed by the Parties) after the date it ceases to be controlled by Customer; (ii) the purchaser of all or substantially all the assets of any line of business of Customer or its Affiliates shall continue to receive Services for up to * (and longer if agreed by the Parties) after the date of purchase, but only with respect to the business acquired. During the Term, Provider shall also provide the Services on Customer’s behalf to such other entities (e.g., doctors, hospitals, home care and home medical equipment companies, and other medical institutions) as Customer may designate from time to time. Notwithstanding the previous sentence, Customer may utilize the Services in support of or as part of Customer’s business operations and offerings, provided that if Customer requires use of the Services in connection with entities that are not Service Recipients and not Customer Affiliates and as a result Provider would incur additional costs to a third party (e.g., additional third party license fees) in an amount representing a Significant Cost Increase, then there will be an equitable adjustment to the charges to accommodate such costs as herein provided.
   - If Customer Directs Provider to provide the Services to an entity pursuant to Section 4.6.1(ii) above and such entity is a Competitor, then Customer shall be deemed to have waived Provider’s compliance with the non-competition obligations under Section 25 below solely with respect to the acquired business. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a purchaser of all or substantially all the assets of any line of business of Customer or its Affiliates seeks to novate the applicable SOW, then Provider will negotiate such novation in good faith.
   - For purposes of this Agreement, (i) the Services provided to the entities referenced in this Section 4.6 shall be deemed to be Services provided to Customer and (ii) all references to “Customer” with respect to receipt of the Services shall be deemed to include the entities referenced in this Section 4.6.

A Party may designate a substitute representative in the event that a designated representative is unable to attend or participate in a Governance Board meeting. All decisions of the Governance Board, whether reached by consensus or by the decision of the Customer representative on the Board as provided below, shall be final and binding upon the Parties.

All meetings of the Governance Board shall be held during U.S. Business Hours on a Business Day as agreed by the Parties, or on no less than three (3) Business Days’ prior written notice if the Parties do not agree otherwise.
   - The Parties desire that decisions of the Governance Board be reached by consensus, if possible. However, if the members of the Governance Board are unable to agree, Customer’s representative on the Governance Board shall be entitled to make the determination on behalf of the Governance Board unilaterally and, if necessary, to amend this Agreement and any SOW accordingly and impose any policy or procedure subject only to the restrictions set forth in Section 5.1.4 below.
   - Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 5.1.3 above, Customer shall not be entitled to impose any amendment to this Agreement, policy or procedure which (i) would cause Provider to be in violation of any applicable law, regulation, or insurance requirement, any agreement entered into in good faith with a third party on an arm’s length basis for purposes not relating to the evasion of this Agreement, or any order of a court or other judicial body to which Provider is or may become subject, or (ii) would unreasonably interfere with Provider’s ability to perform its obligations hereunder. In addition, if any such action on Customer’s part is not provided for in this Agreement or in any applicable SOWs in effect immediately prior to such action, and such action would cause Provider to incur a Significant Cost Increase, then Provider shall be entitled to request the JSC and/or the Governance Board to determine whether Provider is entitled to any additional compensation for its additional costs. If the matter can not be resolved by the JSC or Governance Board, then it may be submitted to dispute resolution in accordance with Article 24 of this Agreement.
   - The Parties shall form a JSC to facilitate communications between them and establish policies and procedures governing the operations of the Parties under this Agreement and any SOWs.

The JSC shall provide general oversight and guidance to the Parties, including serving as the arbiter with respect to issues arising during and from meetings, committees, and work groups formed by the Parties (e.g., change request, reliability, service and performance issues). Upon execution of this Agreement, the initial Customer JSC representatives shall be *; and the initial Provider JSC representatives shall be *, as a non-voting representative. Thereafter, each Party shall notify the other in writing as to changes in its representatives to the JSC. Each such representative shall serve at the pleasure of the designating Party. A Party may (a) designate a substitute representative in the event that a designated representative is unable to participate in a JSC meeting and (b) assign the vote of a representative unable to attend a JSC meeting to a representative who is able to participate in that JSC meeting.
   - The JSC shall be responsible for overseeing day-to-day matters in connection with the Services, and shall report to, and be subject to the authority of, the Governance Board.
   - The JSC shall convene in person or by electronic means as necessary, but no less than quarterly (unless both Parties agree in writing that a particular quarterly meeting is unnecessary), to consider and address such implementation, administration and performance issues as they may deem appropriate, resolve requests for Changes pursuant to Section 4.5, coordinate the performance of each Party’s duties and obligations, and address any issues of common concern. The JSC shall notify the Governance Board of any issue which has or is likely to have significant impact, or be of major concern, or with regard to which the JSC has been unable to reach a decision. Either Customer or Provider may call for a special meeting of the JSC, and add any issue of concern to the committee agenda. The JSC shall maintain a record of the issues considered and any decisions reached, and such decisions, as appropriate, shall be set forth in consecutively numbered amendments or Change Orders to this Agreement or applicable SOWS, as appropriate.

In the event that the JSC fails to resolve an issue, either Party may request that it be referred to the Governance Board for resolution.
   - Each Party shall designate an “Account Manager” who shall be the principal point of contact between the Parties for all matters relating to Services provided under a particular SOW. Each SOW shall contain initial designation of an Account Manager for each Party. A Party may designate a new Account Manager by written notice to the other Party.

5. **Customer’s Obligations**
   - Customer acknowledges and agrees that there may be instances in which Provider will be unable to perform the Services without assistance from Customer. Consequently, Customer will provide to Provider, in a timely manner, such resources specified in each SOW, to enable Provider to perform the Services. Examples of such resources may include connectivity support, documentation, knowledge base, hardware, software, support personnel and trainers. Failure of Customer to provide any such assistance or resources specified in the applicable SOW will not constitute a breach by Customer or Customer Default but will merely be a Relief Event to the extent, and only for so long as, such failure persists and actually causes Provider to be unable or impairs Provider’s ability to provide the affected Services. Provider shall be obligated to perform any Services which are unaffected by such failure on the part of Customer, and Provider shall continue to provide even affected Services to the maximum extent that it is feasible to do so. Any resources not specifically identified in a SOW as Customer’s responsibility to obtain or provide shall be deemed to be Provider’s responsibility.
   - Customer acknowledges and agrees that Provider is relying on the accuracy of the written information and Directions supplied by Customer, and other requirements specified by Customer in writing (cumulatively, the “Processing Norms”), to perform the Services. In the event the Processing Norms are not accurate or are found to be inadequate, the Party discovering such fact shall promptly notify the other Party of any such deficiency and the Parties shall cooperate with each other to remedy the situation in a timely manner. So long as Provider is not otherwise aware of or does not have any reason to believe the Processing Norms supplied by Customer are inaccurate or inadequate or, if Provider is aware of or has reason to believe the Processing Norms supplied by Customer are inaccurate or inadequate, notifies Customer in writing of such fact, Provider shall (i) be entitled to rely on and act in accordance with the Processing Norms, (ii) not incur any liability for claims, losses or damages that arise as a result of Provider’s compliance with the Processing Norms and (iii) be entitled to payment for its performance, and be excused from its poor performance or non-performance of, the Services, to the extent Provider’s performance is predominantly affected by such inaccurate Processing Norms supplied by Customer.
   - Customer grants, or will arrange for third party licensors to grant, to Provider a limited, non-exclusive license to access and use the Customer Software and the Licensed Software in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth on Schedule 6.3 hereto, as they may be amended by Customer or the third party licensors from time to time solely in connection with the performance of Provider’s obligations under this Agreement and under any applicable SOW.
   - Customer hereby grants to Provider a limited non-exclusive license to use Customer Marks solely in connection with the performance of Provider’s obligations under this Agreement, including the right to use Customer’s name over the telephone, the internet and in written materials in performing the Services. Such use of Customer Marks must conform to any written instructions provided by Customer to Provider in this regard, as may be further specified in the applicable SOW. Customer has the right to require Provider to furnish from time to time samples of Provider’s use of Customer Marks.

7. **Business Continuity / Disaster Recovery**
   - The Parties recognize that the Services are vital to Customer’s business and, therefore, it is of paramount importance to Customer that Provider’s provision of the Services remain continuous and disruption-free. In the event Provider’s provision of the Services is disrupted for any reason, it is of corresponding importance to Customer that they be restored rapidly and in a manner that minimizes the impact on Customer’s operations and business. Accordingly, Provider agrees to undertake the business continuity / disaster recovery steps described below and in Schedule 8.1 hereto.
   - During the Term of this Agreement, Provider shall maintain the capabilities and follow the recovery strategies and other measures set forth in Provider’s standard Business Continuity Plan / Disaster Recovery Plan as attached hereto as Schedule 8.1. To the extent requested by Customer, the Parties will work together to modify or supplement such Plan as it pertains to the Services offered under a SOW and include such modified or supplementary plans in such SOW along with any incremental costs associated therewith. Any change to the Business Continuity Plan / Disaster Recovery Plan under any SOW shall be subject to review and approval by the Governance Board. All Business Continuity Plans / Disaster Recovery Plans shall, among other things, specify the alternative location or facility from which the said Services will be rendered.
   - Provider shall familiarize all Provider Personnel with and train Key Provider Personnel in the recovery strategies and procedures set forth in the relevant Business Continuity Plan / Disaster Recovery Plan, particularly as they relate to disaster prevention measures, alternative means of operation and the notification process.
   - If a Provider Facility becomes unavailable (and subject to the applicable disaster recovery provisions of this Agreement and the relevant SOW) or Provider’s ability to provide the Services therefrom is significantly impaired, it is contemplated that Provider will shift some or all of the work to the second Provider Facility from which the Service is provided. If an additional and temporary facility is required in order to provide the Services, the Parties agree that:
     - The charges payable by Customer for the Services provided from the temporary Provider Facility shall be at the same rate as if such Services were being provided prior to the disaster event at the originally planned Facility (i.e., as if such Services were being provided from the now-unavailable Provider Facility);
     - The Services shall be provided from the temporary Provider Facility only for such time as the recovery requires and until the original Provider Facility can be rendered fit for providing the Services; and
     - If the original Provider Facility is permanently unavailable, a permanent site shall be reasonably proposed by Provider and subject to Customer’s approval. Provider’s Disaster Recovery Plan shall specify the location of any back-up facilities.

Part 681), which compliance shall include identifying and procuring required permits, certificates, approvals and inspections. Provider shall be responsible for implementation of, and shall implement, all health care legal and regulatory mandates, including, without limitation, Medicaid Regulations and Medicare Regulations and Payor contract requirements relating to Provider’s performance hereunder, to the extent provided by and Directed by Customer.

   - Similarly, Provider shall have an affirmative duty to notify Customer promptly in writing if Provider becomes aware or otherwise has reason to believe that any such violation has occurred and to identify all Provider Personnel involved with such incident, even if Provider believes the situation has been corrected and/or has already taken all necessary corrective actions. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, Customer shall have the right to require Provider to immediately suspend or remove any such Provider Personnel from the provision of the Services to Customer; and
   - Provider shall take all necessary steps to protect any Provider Personnel who report fraudulent conduct or violations of ethical or regulatory requirements in accordance with Section 9.2.1 above from any direct or indirect harassment or retribution of any kind. Except with the prior written consent of Customer, Provider shall not disclose or attempt to determine or divulge the identity of any such Provider Personnel or attempt to investigate the alleged incident independently.
   - If Customer Directs Provider to perform the Services in a particular manner in order to comply with applicable regulatory or Payor contract requirements, and if Provider fails to so perform the Services in such manner, Customer may claim as damages, and Provider shall be responsible for, and indemnify Customer against, any and all fines, penalties, interest, and similar financial obligations levied against Customer for violations of such requirements, if and to the extent they result from Provider’s failure. Any such indemnification by Provider shall be in accordance with Section 18 below.
   - Customer shall hold and maintain at all times during the term of this Agreement all licenses, consents, authorizations and registrations necessary for it to lawfully receive the Services in the country in which Customer operates; and Provider shall hold and maintain at all times during the term of this Agreement, and shall be responsible for ensuring that any Affiliates and/or contractors engaged by Provider hold and maintain at all such times, all licenses, consents, authorizations and registrations necessary for it to lawfully provide the Services from its offshore locations.
   - Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Provider hereby represents, warrants and covenants that it shall comply with the requirements of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, U.S. and any other applicable foreign or domestic anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws, and other laws governing improper payments. Specifically, Provider further represents, warrants, and covenants that, in connection with its activities under this Agreement, it will not offer, promise, authorize or otherwise act in furtherance or, or pay, anything of value, directly or indirectly, to a Government Official (as such term is hereinafter defined), or political party or party official, candidate for political office, or official of a public international organization. For purposes of this Agreement, the term “Government Official” shall mean and include any official or employee of national, local or provincial or state government department, agency, or instrumentality, as well as an official in the judicial, legislative, or military, anyone acting in an official capacity for any government, or any immediate family member of such persons. Any such offer, promise, authorization, act in furtherance, or payment shall constitute a Provider Default, extinguish any right to compensation that otherwise might be due and owing to Provider by Customer, and give rise to the right of Customer to recover any funds it has already paid to Provider.
   - Provider hereby represents that no owner or principal of Provider is a Government Official and hereby covenants to notify the Customer in writing if there is any change in respect of this representation.
   - Provider shall provide such information, reports and certifications as Customer may reasonably require from time to time hereunder as to its books, records and accounts pertaining to the Services, its compliance with the laws identified in this Section 9.5, and its compliance with other obligations under this Agreement.
   - In connection with the provision of Services under this Agreement, Provider’s use of subcontractors to the extent permitted in Section 10 of this Agreement and Provider’s hiring and employment of Provider Personnel, Provider represents and warrants that it shall not take any action involving a Restricted Party or that would cause Customer to be in non-compliance with OFAC’s economic sanctions regulations. For reference purposes, information on OFAC’s economic sanctions regulations are found at http://www.treas.gov/offices/enforcement/ofac/.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, under no circumstances shall any subcontracting by Provider relieve Provider of any of its obligations under this Agreement.

    - Customer shall pay Provider for the performance of the Services all the amounts in accordance with the terms specified hereunder and the terms specified in the applicable SOW. The procedures for establishing the level of compensation due to Provider under a particular SOW are set forth in Schedule 4.2, Schedule 15.1 and Schedule 15.4 hereto. All compensation and other charges hereunder shall be invoiced and payable in U.S. Dollars only.
    - Unless otherwise specified in a SOW or by other written agreement of the Parties, all third party expenses incurred by Provider in the course of its performance hereunder shall be borne by and remain the sole responsibility of Provider.
    - Provider shall submit monthly invoices by the tenth (10th) Business Day of each month to Customer for the Services performed by Provider during the previous month. All invoices shall be in a format approved by the JSC and shall be accompanied by reasonably detailed descriptions of the Services performed during the preceding month by SOW, the fees related thereto, and the reimbursable disbursements and out-of-pocket expenses, if any, as specified in each SOW, and to support the calculation of any SLA Bonuses and Credits.
    - Except as otherwise provided in a SOW, the rates, fees and charges applicable during (i) the Ramp Up Period of a Service are set forth in Schedule 15.1 hereto (the “RU Rates”), as such RU Rates may be adjusted from time to time in accordance with Schedule 15.4 hereto, and (ii) the Steady State Period of a Service are set forth in each SOW (collectively, the “SS Rates”), as such SS Rates may be adjusted from time to time in accordance with Schedule 15.4 hereto.
    - Each invoice will be paid by Customer within thirty (30) calendar days from receipt of the invoice. If Customer is delinquent in the payment of any undisputed portion of a valid invoice and fails to remedy the delinquency within thirty (30) Business Days after receipt of written notice from Provider that Customer has failed to make such payment, Provider may suspend the Services for which Customer is delinquent in payment until such delinquency is remedied, subject to the conditions and requirements set forth in Section 22.1.2 below. In addition, if Customer is delinquent in paying any undisputed invoice amount for more than thirty (30) calendar days after the due date, Customer may be charged interest on the undisputed amount from the date due until the date paid at the rate of 1.5% (one and one-half percent) per month or the highest rate allowed by law of all past due and outstanding balances on a monthly basis, whichever is less. If Customer in good faith disputes any portion of any invoice, Customer shall submit to Provider following receipt of invoice, written documentation identifying and substantiating the disputed amount. Provider and Customer each agree to use commercially reasonable efforts to resolve any dispute so identified within fifteen (15) Business Days after Provider receives written notice of dispute from Customer. If the Parties are unable to resolve the dispute, it shall be referred to the JSC for resolution; if the JSC shall fail to resolve the dispute within ten (10) Business Days, the issue shall be submitted to the Governance Board for resolution; and if the Governance Board shall fail to resolve the dispute within ten (10) Business Days, the issue shall be submitted for Level III Dispute Resolution in accordance with Section 24.3. Any disputed amounts resolved in favor of Customer shall be noted on the next invoice following resolution of the dispute; any disputed amounts determined to be payable to Provider shall be due within seven (7) Business Days of the resolution of the dispute. Notwithstanding anything contained herein, all payments in respect of undisputed portions of each invoice and undisputed invoices shall be payable by Customer within thirty (30) calendar days of its receipt of each respective invoice.
    - Customer shall be responsible for all applicable federal, state or local use, excise, sales or other taxes, fees, assessments, surcharges or similar governmental charges that may be imposed, levied, collected or assessed by or within the United States of America or any political subdivision thereof in connection with Provider’s provision of the Services to Customer hereunder (collectively, “Applicable Taxes”); provided, however, Customer shall have no responsibility or liability for any Applicable Taxes that are (i) based on or attributable to Provider’s income, whether gross or net (“Income Taxes”), or (ii) ad valorem or property taxes with respect to any real or personal property or other asset owned, leased, or used by Provider (“Ad Valorem Taxes”). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, Provider shall be solely responsible for, and shall indemnify and hold Customer harmless from, any Income Taxes or Ad Valorem Taxes.
    - If Customer is required by law to make any deduction or withholding of Income Taxes or Ad Valorem Taxes from any payment due to Provider under this Agreement, Customer will (i) prepare and submit any necessary filings and remit such Taxes to the appropriate taxing authority, and (ii) provide Provider with evidence of Customer’s withholding and payment to the appropriate taxing authorities. The Parties acknowledge and agree, however, that no such deduction or withholding shall apply if Provider has provided Customer with a timely, appropriate and duly executed Internal Revenue Service Form W-9, W 8BEN or W-8ECI, or an official alternate, substitute or replacement form, as the case may be, that substantiates an exemption from such Taxes. Under no circumstances shall Customer be required or obligated (a) to allow Provider an exemption from any Applicable Taxes (i.e. not make a required deduction or withholding and remittance) if Provider fails to provide Customer with such timely, appropriate and executed exemption certificate and any extensions or updates required thereto or (b) gross up any Income Taxes or Ad Valorem Taxes that Customer is required by law to deduct or withhold from any payment due to Provider hereunder.
    - Either Party is entitled to contest the amount or validity of the imposition of any Applicable Taxes, and each Party agrees to furnish reasonable cooperation to the contesting Party in any proceeding contesting the amount or validity of imposition of such Applicable Taxes.
    - Customer may set off, as a credit against any monthly charges payable to Provider under this Agreement, any SLA Credits owed to Customer pursuant to any SOW, any mutually agreed amounts to be paid, reimbursed, credited or otherwise owed or owing to Customer by Provider under this Agreement and any amounts that are determined to be owed to Customer in accordance with Section 24.3; provided that with respect to fees or services already paid by Customer that Customer later disputes, Customer must set off such amounts within ninety (90) days after payment of such disputed fees or services. Notwithstanding the ninety (90) day limitation above, Customer may set off (pursuant to this Section 15.7) any amounts owing to Customer, as identified in audits performed pursuant to this Agreement.
    - At all times while this Agreement is in effect and for at least five (5) years following its expiration or termination, Provider shall keep and maintain its books, records and accounts in reasonable detail to accurately, completely and fairly reflect its activities and transactions hereunder, including the recipient and nature of every payment or expenditure in connection with Provider’s activities to perform its obligations under this Agreement. Without limiting the foregoing, Provider shall maintain complete and accurate records of and supporting documentation for the amounts billable to and payments made by Customer hereunder, to the extent required to comply with Section 16 and in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles applied on a consistent basis. Provider agrees to provide Customer with documentation and other information with respect to each invoice as may be reasonably requested by Customer to verify accuracy and compliance with the provisions of this Agreement.
    - Except as may be otherwise provided in this Agreement, all periodic charges under this Agreement shall be computed on a calendar month basis, and shall be prorated for any partial month.
    - If Provider should receive a refund, credit or other rebate for goods or services previously paid for by Customer, Provider shall promptly notify Customer of such refund, credit or rebate and shall promptly pay the full amount of such refund, credit or rebate, as the case may be, to Customer.

Provider shall have ten (10) days following receipt of such notification within which Provider may present Customer with any information or evidence Provider may have indicating that Customer’s determination was incorrect, and Customer agrees to consider any such information provided.
