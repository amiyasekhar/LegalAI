Promptly after receipt by either party hereto seeking indemnification pursuant to Section 7.2 (an "Indemnified Party") of written notice of any investigation, claim, proceeding or other action in respect of which indemnification is being sought (each, a "Claim"), the Indemnified Party promptly shall notify the party against whom indemnification pursuant to Section 7.2 is being sought (the "Indemnifying Party") of the commencement thereof; but the omission to so notify the Indemnifying Party shall not relieve it from any liability that it otherwise may have to the Indemnified Party, except to the extent that the Indemnifying Party is materially prejudiced and forfeits substantive rights and defenses by reason of such failure. In connection with any Claim as to which both the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party are parties, the Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to assume the defense thereof. Notwithstanding the assumption of the defense of any Claim by the Indemnifying Party, the Indemnified Party shall have the right to employ separate legal counsel and to participate in the defense of such Claim, and the Indemnifying Party shall bear the reasonable fees, out-of-pocket costs and expenses of such separate legal counsel to the Indemnified Party if (and only if): (x) the Indemnifying Party shall have agreed to pay such fees, out-of-pocket costs and expenses, (y) the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party reasonably shall have concluded that representation of the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party by the same legal counsel would not be appropriate due to actual or, as reasonably determined by legal counsel to the Indemnified Party, potentially differing interests between such parties in the conduct of the defense of such Claim, or if there may be legal defenses available to the Indemnified Party that are in addition to or disparate from those available to the Indemnifying Party, or (z) the Indemnifying Party shall have failed to employ legal counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party within a reasonable period of time after notice of the commencement of such Claim. If the Indemnified Party employs separate legal counsel in circumstances other than as described in clauses (x), (y) or (z) above, the fees, costs and expenses of such legal counsel shall be borne exclusively by the Indemnified Party. Except as provided above, the Indemnifying Party shall not, in connection with any Claim in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one firm of legal counsel for the Indemnified Party (together with appropriate local counsel). The Indemnifying Party shall not, without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party (which consent shall not unreasonably be withheld), settle or compromise any Claim or consent to the entry of any judgment that does not include an unconditional release of the Indemnified Party from all liabilities with respect to such Claim or judgment.
