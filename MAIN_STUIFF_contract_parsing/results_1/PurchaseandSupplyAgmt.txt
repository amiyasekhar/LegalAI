Content: 

Heading: Section 1.2Minimum Commitment. In each calendar quarter during the Term,Buyeragrees to purchase and accept delivery fromSellerof, andSelleragrees to sell and ship toBuyer, Components having an aggregate purchase price not less than the respective minimum commitment amounts set forth below:
Content: Calendar Quarter Ending   Minimum Commitment    Rs.[●]   Rs.[●]   Rs.[●]   Rs.[●]   Rs.[●]   Rs.[●]   Rs.[●]   Rs.[●]  (for each calendar quarter, and as it may be reduced or modified by the terms hereof, the “Minimum Commitment”). The Minimum Commitment shall be satisfied byBuyerPurchases; provided, however, that, to the extent thatBuyerPurchases in a calendar quarter exceed the Minimum Commitment for that calendar quarter, such excess shall not carry over to be applied against the Minimum Commitment for any subsequent calendar quarter. As used herein, “BuyerPurchases” means the aggregate amount the purchase price (without giving effect to the Shortfall Surcharge (defined below)) of purchases of Components fromSellerand other of the Parent’s products that are shipped bySellertoBuyerduring a given calendar quarter or that have Original Delivery Dates (as defined in Section 3.1) or scheduled delivery dates otherwise mutually agreed upon in writing, in each case within such calendar quarter if not shipped during that calendar quarter. For purposes of this Section 1.2,BuyerPurchases include purchase of Components fromSellerby any subsidiary ofBuyerin whichBuyerowns over 50% or by an entity which controlsBuyer(owns 50% or greater ownership inBuyer); provided, however, that purchases by any of the entities specified inSchedule 1.2hereto shall not be included asBuyerPurchases.  IfBuyerfails to satisfy the Minimum Commitment for any calendar quarter,Buyershall pay toSellerin cash, within[●]days following such calendar quarter, an amount equal to the Shortfall Surcharge. As used herein, “Shortfall Surcharge” for any calendar quarter means the difference between the (a) Adjusted Minimum Commitment (defined as Minimum Commitment less (i) Performance and Component Availability Adjustments and (ii) Guaranteed Supply Adjustments) for such calendar quarter and (b)BuyerPurchases for such calendar quarter.Buyeragrees to promptly notifySellerin the eventBuyerexpects to not achieve its Minimum Commitment in any period. In the event that a Shortfall Surcharge shall be payable with respect to any calendar quarter, the amount of the Shortfall Surcharge shall be deemed to have been allocated pro rata among all Components shipped during such calendar quarter as an increase in the purchase price thereof.

Heading: Section 1.3Guaranteed Capacity.Selleragrees that it will allocate sufficient production capacity toBuyerto meet[●]of the Minimum Commitment, subject to the other provisions of this Agreement, including the provisions of Section 2.4 regarding lead times.
Content: 

Heading: Section 1.4Performance and Component Availability. (a)Buyerwill provideSellerwith quarterly product roadmaps and specifications for futureBuyerproducts.Buyerwill consider in good faith utilizing Components fromSellerin products under development byBuyerprovided that such Components are Competitive.BuyerandSellershall in good faith discuss, and mutually agree in writing from time to time, upon the requirements for Components to be deemed “Competitive”. The requirements will be based upon whether such products (i) have key performance parameter limits that are within the key performance parameter limits for a third party component thatBuyermight otherwise utilize, (ii) meet the specification requirements ofBuyer’s product design, (iii) have been fully released to manufacturing bySeller, (iv) are to be projected to be available in quantities necessary to support the projectedBuyerproduction requirements and (v) have a competitive price. The parties agree that the Components listed onSchedule 1.4hereto are deemed to be Competitive in theBuyerproducts for which they currently are utilized as of the date hereof.Sellershall be afforded a period of[●]months from the date that production parts are commercially available (or, if later, from the date the parties have mutually agreed upon therequirements for a Component to be Competitive) in which to develop and release such Competitive products to manufacturing.
Content: (b) In the event thatBuyerdetermines to “lock in” a Component in its design ofBuyerproducts, it shall give written notice toSellerof its determination with respect to such Component (a “LockedinComponent”). Thereafter, subject to the other provisions of this Agreement, if Locked In Components are not available fromSellerthat meet the Competitive requirements, and if other Components from theSellerportfolio are not available which would otherwise meetBuyer’s Competitive requirements for the Minimum Commitment, then therupeevolume of these Components which are purchased byBuyerfrom other vendors in a calendar quarter shall be deemed to be a “Performance and Product Availability Adjustment” for purposes of the Minimum Commitment for such quarter.

Heading: Section 1.5Guaranteed Supply. Subject to the other provisions of this Agreement,Sellershall assure supply toBuyerof all Components that have been designed intoBuyer’s products. In the event thatSellerdecides to discontinue manufacturing and delivery of certain Components (“End-of-Life”),Sellerwill accept all purchase orders provided byBuyer(“Last Time Buy”) of the specific part number(s) subject toSeller’s End of Life notification for a period of[●]months from the date of notification andSelleragrees that delivery will not exceed[●]months from the date of such notification.Buyer’s Last Time Buy must be placed before the expiration of the[●]month period following theEnd-of-Lifenotification. All Last Time Buy purchase orders shall be placed on a non-cancellableand non-refundable basis and marked as such onBuyer’s purchase orders. The price for finished Components purchased under a Last Time Buy will be subject to the prices or pricing criteria, as outlined in Section 1.6.
Content: Buyerwill make reasonable efforts to assess its Last Time Buy requirements for each product being subject to anEnd-of-Lifenotification and place an order for such requirement. In addition,Buyermay request that a portion of the Life Time Buy be in the form of Qualified Die Bank. “Qualified Die Bank” is defined as die in wafer form which has been subjected to the wafer fabrication process and has had a sample of[●]die across the wafer selected and then packaged and tested for those specific[●]die to confirm that the wafer will yield good RF performance devices at an economic yield. The approval bySellerof such aBuyerrequest for a portion of its Last Time Buy in the form of Qualified Die Bank will not be unreasonably withheld.Buyershall purchase the Qualified Die Bank under provisions of the Last Time Buy stated above, and will bear the risk for die yield. The price for Qualified Die Bank will be no greater than the lower of (i) market price and (ii)[●]ofSeller’s standard manufacturing cost (which shall include a reasonable manufacturing overhead allocation).  In the event thatSelleris unable to satisfyBuyer’s Last Time Buy or Qualified Die Bank request for bipolar technology Components which have been designed intoBuyerproducts prior to the Effective Date,Selleragrees to transfer a royalty free license of the manufacturing process (including packaging technology, unlessSelleragrees to provide suchservices toBuyerto complete the Qualified Die Bank at a reasonable cost) to suchEnd-of-Lifebipolar Components toBuyer(or a designee approved bySeller, such approval not to be unreasonably withheld) to be manufactured exclusively forBuyerand be forBuyer’s own use, in order to ensure that the supply of such devices toBuyerremains uninterrupted. The technical information to support such transfer will be provided at cost so as to ensure that there is no interruption in supply and in no event later than[●]months after the End of Life notification.  In the event thatBuyerpurchases Components subsequent to anEnd-of-Lifenotification from another vendor by virtue of the fact thatSellercould not deliver Components toBuyerunderBuyer’s Last Time Buy purchase orders, then the purchases of such Components from another vendor other thanSellershall be deemed to be a “Guaranteed Supply Adjustment” for purposes of the Minimum Commitment.  Notwithstanding the foregoing,Selleragrees tonotEnd of Life any Components during the[●]monthperiod following the Effective Date except as disclosed onSchedule 1.5.

Heading: Section 1.6Qualified Die Bank Purchases. From time to time,Buyermay request thatSellerprovide it with Qualified Die Bank without regard to the Life Time Buy provisions above. The approval bySellerof such aBuyerrequest will not be unreasonably withheld, butBuyershall bear the risk for die yield. The price for such Qualified Die Bank shall be[●]ofSeller’s standard manufacturing cost (which shall include a reasonable manufacturing overhead allocation). Any such purchase of Qualified Die Bank shall be credited against the Minimum Commitment for the quarter in which such purchase is made. Such Qualified Die Bank may be held byBuyerand thereafter submitted toSellerfor Component finishing, in which case the price of the Component shall be the difference between the Component price determined pursuant to Section 1.7 and the price previously paid for such Qualified Die Bank. The differential in price shall be credited against the Minimum Commitment for the quarter in which such Component is shipped. Any Qualified Die Bank purchased byBuyerhereunder may not be sold or transferred to any party other thanSeller.

For shipments of LDMOS products after the quarter ending[●]the parties shall negotiate in good faith, not less than[●]days prior to the start of a calendar quarter, the price for LDMOS products to be shipped during such calendar quarter. The parties agree to negotiate in good faith (i) changes to the LDMOS prices set forth in Appendix A from time to time in the future and (ii) prices for new Components, in each case based to ensure best available commercial price at a similar volume purchase discount and a cost per watt benchmark for substantially equivalent products of any leading competitor where specificcomparable price is not available. In the event thatSellerelects not to meet the best available commercial price for a particular product having equivalent specifications to theSellerComponent, where such price is offered in writing toBuyerfor quantities not less than thoseBuyerwould otherwise purchase fromSellerunder this Agreement, andSellerhas had at least[●]days after its receipt of a copy of the third party offer in which to meet such price,Buyermay purchase such product from athird-partyvendor at such lower price, in which case such purchase will be credited against the Minimum Commitment.
Content: Notwithstanding the foregoing,Sellershall provideBuyerwith its “mostfavouredcustomers” pricing with respect all ofBuyer’s Component purchases (without regard to volume or mix) for all purchase orders placed during the[●]consecutive[●]monthperiods following the Effective Date, with the “mostfavouredcustomer pricing” determined at the timeBuyersubmits its purchase order.  (b) The Component prices do not include sales, use, consumption or excise taxes of any taxing authority.
