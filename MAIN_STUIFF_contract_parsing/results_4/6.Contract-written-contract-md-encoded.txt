Any zulily Indemnified Party or Provider Indemnified Party (each an “***Indemnified Party***”) believing that it is entitled to indemnification under this Agreement will give prompt written notice to Provider or zulily (an “***Indemnifying Party***”) of the commencement of any Claim for which indemnification may be sought or, if earlier, upon the assertion of any such Claim (it being understood and agreed, however, that the failure of the Indemnified Party to give notice of a Claim as provided in this <u>Section 7.4</u> will not relieve an Indemnifying Party of its indemnification obligation under this Agreement unless the Indemnifying Party is materially disadvantaged by such delay). Within 30 days after delivery of such notification, the Indemnifying Party will, upon written notice to the Indemnified Party, assume control of the defense of such Claim with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party; provided that the Indemnifying Party has accepted its indemnity and defense obligations without reservation. If the Indemnifying Party has reserved any rights with respect to defense or indemnity, the Indemnified Party will control the defense. If the Indemnifying Party believes that a Claim presented to it for indemnification is one as to which the Indemnified Party is not entitled to indemnification under this Agreement, it will so notify the Indemnified Party on a prompt basis (but in no event later than 30 days after delivery of notification of the Claim). The Indemnified Party may participate in such defense at its own expense; <u>provided</u> <u>that</u> if the Indemnified Party reasonably concludes, based on advice from counsel, that the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party have conflicting interests with respect to such Claim, the Indemnifying Party will be responsible for the reasonable fees and expenses of independent counsel to the Indemnified Party. The Indemnifying Party will keep the Indemnified Party advised of the status of such Claim and the defense thereof and will consider recommendations made by the Indemnified Party with respect thereto. The Indemnified Party will not agree to any settlement of such Claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party.

Entry: | 7.4 | <u>Indemnification Procedures</u>. Any zulily Indemnified Party or Provider Indemnified Party (each an “***Indemnified Party***”) believing that it is entitled to indemnification under this Agreement will give prompt written notice to Provider or zulily (an “***Indemnifying Party***”) of the commencement of any Claim for which indemnification may be sought or, if earlier, upon the assertion of any such Claim (it being understood and agreed, however, that the failure of the Indemnified Party to give notice of a Claim as provided in this <u>Section 7.4</u> will not relieve an Indemnifying Party of its indemnification obligation under this Agreement unless the Indemnifying Party is materially disadvantaged by such delay). Within 30 days after delivery of such notification, the Indemnifying Party will, upon written notice to the Indemnified Party, assume control of the defense of such Claim with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party; provided that the Indemnifying Party has accepted its indemnity and defense obligations without reservation. If the Indemnifying Party has reserved any rights with respect to defense or indemnity, the Indemnified Party will control the defense. If the Indemnifying Party believes that a Claim presented to it for indemnification is one as to which the Indemnified Party is not entitled to indemnification under this Agreement, it will so notify the Indemnified Party on a prompt basis (but in no event later than 30 days after delivery of notification of the Claim). The Indemnified Party may participate in such defense at its own expense; <u>provided</u> <u>that</u> if the Indemnified Party reasonably concludes, based on advice from counsel, that the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party have conflicting interests with respect to such Claim, the Indemnifying Party will be responsible for the reasonable fees and expenses of independent counsel to the Indemnified Party.
