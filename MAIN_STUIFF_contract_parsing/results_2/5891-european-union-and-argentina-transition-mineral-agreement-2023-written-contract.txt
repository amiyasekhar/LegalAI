Entry:  ON A STRATEGIC PARTNERSHIP ON SUSTAINABLE RAW MATERIALS VALUE CHAINS
Entry:  BETWEEN THE EUROPEAN UNION AND THE ARGENTINE REPUBLIC
Entry:  Introduction
Entry:  Objectives
Entry:  The European Union - EU- and the Argentine Republic (hereinafter "the Participants") wish to establish a strategic partnership on sustainable raw materials value chains (hereinafter "the Partnership") through signing this Memorandum of Understanding (the Memorandum). In the framework of the Partnership, the Participants intend to deepen cooperation in the field of sustainable raw materials value chains that support the clean energy and digital transition.
Entry:  The Participants are both committed to improve the sustainability of raw materials supply chains and recognise that securing a sustainable supply of strategic and critical raw materials listed in the Annex, is an essential prerequisite for delivering on clean energy and digital objectives.
Entry:  Concretely, the Partnership, based on mutual benefits, aims to support:
Entry:  identifying and jointly developing innovative and sustainable and responsible raw materials value chain projects by facilitating business opportunities, deploying financial support, investment de-risking instruments;
Entry:  closer economic and industrial integration of the Participants in sustainable value chain of raw
Entry:  materials;
Entry:  cooperation to increase resilience of raw materials value chains;
Entry:  -|-|-|**EMPTY PARA**|-|-|-developing the Argentine Republic's sustainable raw materials value chains in its environmental, social and economic dimensions as a lever for a sustainable and inclusive economic growth, the creation of local added value, quality employment, the development of local industrialization and domestic revenue mobilisation; thereby increasing the competitiveness ofthe Argentine economy;
Entry:  the development of open, resilient and competitive markets for raw, processed and recycled
Entry:  materials, allowing the EU to diversify its suppliers for materials necessary in particular to achieve the clean and digital transition and its open strategic autonomy;
Entry:  promoting the alignment of sustainable raw materials value chains developed between the EU
Entry:  and the Argentine Republic with internationally agreed principles and guidelines for environmental, social and governance (ESG) standards;
Entry:  cooperation on skills, capacity building and competences necessary for the development of sustainable raw materials value chains, including the promotion of the most sustainable extraction and transformation practices, and circular economy;
Entry:  -|-|-|**EMPTY PARA**|-|-|-
Entry:  -|-|-|**EMPTY PARA**|-|-|-to facilitate closer cooperation on research and innovation along the raw materials value chain, including advanced exploration, earth observation, innovative extractive, processing, refining and recycling technologies;
Entry:  Policy context
Entry:  Currently the EU and the Argentine Republic relations are governed by the Framework Agreement for Trade and Economic Cooperation between the European Community and the Argentine Republic signed in 1990, which establishes the basis for bilateral cooperation in foreign trade, economy, agriculture and industry. The Participants also signed a specific agreement, the Agreement for Scientific and Technological Cooperation between the European Community and the Argentine Republic, in 1999. Moreover, the EU and the Argentine Republic, as part of Mercosur, have politically concluded the negotiations for an Association Agreement. During the XII EU - Argentina Joint Cooperation Commission (June 2022) both parties agreed to launch the negotiations for new bilateral institutional framework to strengthening our Partnership and fostering bi-regional dialogue on cooperation1.
Entry:  Scope of the Partnership
Entry:  The Partnership covers strategic and critical raw materials listed in the Annex that are necessary for the clean energy and digital transition, covering the entire value chain - exploration, extraction, refining, processing, and recycling - including extractive waste and the value adding downstream industries.
Entry:  This Memorandum envisages to set the framework for shared commitment to enhance cooperation in the field of raw materials value chains for the clean energy transition in following five (5) areas of collaboration:
Entry:  integration of sustainable raw materials value chains, including networking, joint development of projects (e.g. via joint ventures), creation of new business models and promotion and facilitation of trade and investment linkages, ensuring the well-functioning, sustainability and resilience of these raw materials value chains;
Entry:  cooperation on research and innovation along the raw materials value chains, including on minerals knowledge, the minimisation of environmental and climate footprint, and circular ewnomy;
Entry:  cooperation to leverage Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) Criteria and align with international standards;
Entry:  deployment of hard and soft infrastructure for projects development, minimising their environmental and climate impact, in accordance with international ESG standards; strengthen capacities, training and skills development along sustainable raw materials value chains in accordance with international labour standards.
