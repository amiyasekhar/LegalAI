Entry:   
Entry:  Service Level Agreement
Entry:   
Entry:  This Service Level Agreement (“SLA”) describes Miso’s commitment to Product availability.
Entry:   
Entry:  Definitions
Entry:   
Entry:  For purposes of this SLA, the following definitions shall apply:
Entry:   
Entry:  “Operating Hours” means the time during which the Product is “clocked-in” for use. Miso utilizes a clock in/clock-out approach to calculate Operating Hours. A clock-in event occurs when Customer’s worker starts the Product via the user interface. Similarly, a clock-out event occurs when Customer’s worker shuts down the Product through the user interface or otherwise. The period between a clock-in event and a clock-out event shall be considered “Clocked Time”. Operating Hours for a particular month consists of the sum of all periods of Clocked Time for that month.
Entry:   
Entry:  “Outage” means a critical full outage/severe issue that constitutes a catastrophic problem that causes complete inability to use the Product, resulting in production downtime and where there is no workaround or solution to the problem.
Entry:   
Entry:  "Excluded" means that period of time during which the Product is unavailable or inoperable due to any of the following: (i) Force Majeure or circumstances beyond Miso’s reasonable control; (ii) Customer's combination of the Product with any hardware or software not supplied by Miso or not identified by Miso in writing as compatible with the Product; (iii) issues in Customer’s environment, network, power supply or infrastructure; (iv) telecommunications or internet service provider failures, or loss of availability due to a network attack such as DDoS, SYN or similar attacks, or issues caused by DNS resolution and/or domain name or certificate expiration; (v) regularly scheduled or emergency maintenance; or (vi) improper use, alteration, or damage of the Product.
Entry:   
Entry:  "Monthly Uptime" means (total Operating Hours in calendar month – Excluded - Outage durations) / (total Operating Hours in calendar month - Excluded) X 100%.
Entry:   
Entry:  Service Commitment and Remedies
Entry:   
Entry:  Miso’s service commitment is to maintain a Monthly Uptime of 99.9% for the Product in a given calendar month. All availability calculations will be based on Miso’s system records. Miso will provide Customer with a Monthly Uptime Report, including reasonable supporting detail for Outages and Excluded periods, within ten (10) days of the end of each month during the Term.
Entry:   
Entry:  In the event Miso fails to meet the service commitment during two (2) or more consecutive calendar months, Customer’s exclusive remedy for such downtime is to receive a credit equal to the prorated amount of Monthly Recurring Fees applicable to the downtime, which credit shall be applied against the next subsequent invoice(s) until the credit is exhausted.
Entry:   
Entry:  To receive the above remedy, the failures must be reported by Customer to their Miso-appointed Robot Support Specialist or other Miso-appointed support representative within twenty (20) days of the end of the last month of the consecutive two-month period for which a credit claim is made.
Entry:   
Entry:  The report submitted by Customer must identify (i) the applicable Product and Installation Site, (ii) the dates, times and duration of downtimes, and (iii) any technical support requested or remediation implemented. Before processing any credit request, Miso will validate the information provided in the request to confirm the loss of availability, its timeframe, and corresponding credit.
