Type(s): Remedies, Performance Standards, Termination, Obligations of the Parties, Notices, Service Level Agreement, Service Continuity, Force Majeure, Pricing and Fees, Technical Assistance, Payment Terms, Liquidated Damages, Governing Currency
Content: Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, Provider agrees that no Force Majeure Event that affects Provider’s performance hereunder shall relieve Provider from its obligations for a period of more than three (3) days from the date on which Provider notifies or should have notified Customer of a Force Majeure Event. After the elapse of such period, all SLAs and other covenants applicable to Provider’s performance under this Agreement or any SOW shall again be in full force and effect. In addition, if any Force Majeure Event substantially prevents, hinders or delays Provider’s performance of the Services such that it substantially interferes with Customer’s business for more than twenty four (24) hours, then Provider shall immediately shift its provision of the Services from the affected Facility to a Disaster Recovery Site described in Section 8 above (if Provider has not done so already). If the Force Majeure Event continues for more than three (3) consecutive days and Provider’s performance falls below the Catastrophic Failure Service threshold with respect to a Service, which for this purpose shall be no lower than 80% of the baseline Service Level specified in an applicable SOW (as supplemented by the SSIO thereto) with respect to any Service, then Customer may, at its option and without violation of the volume obligations under such SOW, procure such Service from an alternate source, and Provider shall be liable for payment for such Service from the alternate source, less any amounts that Customer did not pay to Provider as the result of Services not being rendered, for the lesser of (i) the period of time in which Provider’s performance remains so impaired, and (ii) thirty (30) days. Finally, effective beginning seven (7) days after Provider’s notification of the Force Majeure Event, in the event Provider’s performance remains below the Catastrophic Failure Service threshold with respect to a Service, which for this purpose shall be no lower than 80% of the baseline Service Level specified in an applicable SOW (as supplemented by the SSIO thereto) with respect to any Service, Customer may (x) terminate any portion of this Agreement so affected in whole or in part without penalty or fee, and the charges payable hereunder shall be equitably adjusted to reflect those terminated Services; or (y) terminate this Agreement in whole without liability to Provider, as of a date specified by Customer in a written notice of termination to Provider. Subject to the preceding sentence, Provider shall not have the right to any additional payments from Customer for costs or expenses incurred by Provider as a result of any Force Majeure Event. For the avoidance of doubt, the Parties agree the foregoing rights of Customer shall be in addition to and not in lieu of any other remedies available to Customer hereunder or under law or equity.
