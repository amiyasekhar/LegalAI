Provider will provide the following Services at the Facility identified below during the term of the Agreement (references to “Services” in this SOW refer to the Services to be provided under this SOW):

Child 282 (p):
Provider will provide, supply and assign personnel comprising a workforce at the Facility [*]. The Parties understand, acknowledge and accept that conditions or events subsequent (e.g., injury, illness, rules violation, change of employer) may cause a change to the composition of the permanently assigned personnel, but that any such change will be followed by a new associate being permanently assigned to fill a position and contribute to the workforce of a minimum of [*] associates. Neither the workforce of a minimum of [*] associates cumulatively nor any of the personnel assigned individually constitute contingent or temporary labor to handle peak volume or seasonal work.

Child 283 (p):
Provider will serve as a primary point of entry for employees for zulily Facilities. Provider responsibilities under this SOW include recruiting, screening, onboarding and hiring processes, site management, benefits and PTO plans, retention strategies, site specific reporting, the maintenance of software data feeds (for IS workforce), the screening, management and billing of subcontractors when applicable, and ongoing access to Provider MARS and implementations teams as business needs dictate.
