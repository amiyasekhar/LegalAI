Definitions

Child 222 (p):
For purposes of this SLA, the following definitions shall apply:

Child 223 (p):
 

Child 224 (p):
“Operating Hours” means the time during which the Product is “clocked-in” for use. Miso utilizes a clock in/clock-out approach to calculate Operating Hours. A clock-in event occurs when Customer’s worker starts the Product via the user interface. Similarly, a clock-out event occurs when Customer’s worker shuts down the Product through the user interface or otherwise. The period between a clock-in event and a clock-out event shall be considered “Clocked Time”. Operating Hours for a particular month consists of the sum of all periods of Clocked Time for that month.

Child 225 (p):
 

Child 226 (p):
“Outage” means a critical full outage/severe issue that constitutes a catastrophic problem that causes complete inability to use the Product, resulting in production downtime and where there is no workaround or solution to the problem.

Child 227 (p):
 

Child 228 (p):
"Excluded" means that period of time during which the Product is unavailable or inoperable due to any of the following: (i) Force Majeure or circumstances beyond Miso’s reasonable control; (ii) Customer's combination of the Product with any hardware or software not supplied by Miso or not identified by Miso in writing as compatible with the Product; (iii) issues in Customer’s environment, network, power supply or infrastructure; (iv) telecommunications or internet service provider failures, or loss of availability due to a network attack such as DDoS, SYN or similar attacks, or issues caused by DNS resolution and/or domain name or certificate expiration; (v) regularly scheduled or emergency maintenance; or (vi) improper use, alteration, or damage of the Product.
