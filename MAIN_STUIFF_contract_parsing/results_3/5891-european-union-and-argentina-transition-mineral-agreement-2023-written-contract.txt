Child 12 (p):
The Participants are both committed to improve the sustainability of raw materials supply chains and recognise that securing a sustainable supply of strategic and critical raw materials listed in the Annex, is an essential prerequisite for delivering on clean energy and digital objectives.

Child 13 (p):
Concretely, the Partnership, based on mutual benefits, aims to support:

Child 14 (p):
identifying and jointly developing innovative and sustainable and responsible raw materials value chain projects by facilitating business opportunities, deploying financial support, investment de-risking instruments;

Child 15 (p):
closer economic and industrial integration of the Participants in sustainable value chain of raw

Child 16 (p):
materials;

Child 17 (p):
cooperation to increase resilience of raw materials value chains;

Child 18 (p):
developing the Argentine Republic's sustainable raw materials value chains in its environmental, social and economic dimensions as a lever for a sustainable and inclusive economic growth, the creation of local added value, quality employment, the development of local industrialization and domestic revenue mobilisation; thereby increasing the competitiveness ofthe Argentine economy;

Child 19 (p):
the development of open, resilient and competitive markets for raw, processed and recycled

Child 20 (p):
materials, allowing the EU to diversify its suppliers for materials necessary in particular to achieve the clean and digital transition and its open strategic autonomy;

Child 21 (p):
promoting the alignment of sustainable raw materials value chains developed between the EU

Child 22 (p):
and the Argentine Republic with internationally agreed principles and guidelines for environmental, social and governance (ESG) standards;

Child 23 (p):
cooperation on skills, capacity building and competences necessary for the development of sustainable raw materials value chains, including the promotion of the most sustainable extraction and transformation practices, and circular economy;

***THIS IS AN EMPTY PARA***

Child 30 (p):
Currently the EU and the Argentine Republic relations are governed by the Framework Agreement for Trade and Economic Cooperation between the European Community and the Argentine Republic signed in 1990, which establishes the basis for bilateral cooperation in foreign trade, economy, agriculture and industry. The Participants also signed a specific agreement, the Agreement for Scientific and Technological Cooperation between the European Community and the Argentine Republic, in 1999. Moreover, the EU and the Argentine Republic, as part of Mercosur, have politically concluded the negotiations for an Association Agreement. During the XII EU - Argentina Joint Cooperation Commission (June 2022) both parties agreed to launch the negotiations for new bilateral institutional framework to strengthening our Partnership and fostering bi-regional dialogue on cooperation1.

Child 31 (p):
Scope of the Partnership

Child 32 (p):
The Partnership covers strategic and critical raw materials listed in the Annex that are necessary for the clean energy and digital transition, covering the entire value chain - exploration, extraction, refining, processing, and recycling - including extractive waste and the value adding downstream industries.

Child 33 (p):
This Memorandum envisages to set the framework for shared commitment to enhance cooperation in the field of raw materials value chains for the clean energy transition in following five (5) areas of collaboration:

Child 34 (p):
integration of sustainable raw materials value chains, including networking, joint development of projects (e.g. via joint ventures), creation of new business models and promotion and facilitation of trade and investment linkages, ensuring the well-functioning, sustainability and resilience of these raw materials value chains;

Child 35 (p):
cooperation on research and innovation along the raw materials value chains, including on minerals knowledge, the minimisation of environmental and climate footprint, and circular ewnomy;

Child 36 (p):
cooperation to leverage Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) Criteria and align with international standards;

Child 37 (p):
deployment of hard and soft infrastructure for projects development, minimising their environmental and climate impact, in accordance with international ESG standards; strengthen capacities, training and skills development along sustainable raw materials value chains in accordance with international labour standards.
