Clause: '2. **Term**
   - This Agreement shall commence on the Effective Date and shall continue, unless earlier terminated in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement, for a period of seven (7) years (the “Initial Term”). Unless otherwise provided, the termination or expiration of a Statement of Work shall not automatically terminate this Agreement, but the termination or expiration of this Agreement shall automatically terminate all Statements of Work. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in accordance with Section 26.18 below, any obligation undertaken hereunder by either Party that, by its nature or its terms, is intended to extend beyond the Term shall survive the termination hereof.
   - Should a Party wish to continue this Agreement after the Initial Term or the then existing Term, such Party shall give the other Party a request in writing to renew this Agreement no later than seven (7) months prior to the expiration of Initial Term or the then-existing Term, as the case may be. Upon receipt of such request to extend the Term of the Agreement, the other Party shall have thirty (30) days in which to accept, in writing, such request for extension. A failure to accept such request within the specified period shall be deemed to be a rejection, in which case neither Party shall have any obligation to negotiate any type of extension of the Term of this Agreement. If the other Party accepts an extension request, the Parties will thereafter negotiate in good faith the terms and conditions that will apply during the extended term (each an “Extended Term”) with a goal of reaching mutual agreement at least six (6) months prior to the expiration of the then-existing Term.
   - Each SOW shall set forth the applicable term for the SOW (each, a “SOW Term”), which SOW Term shall continue for the Term of this Agreement unless the Parties mutually agree in writing otherwise, except that all SOWs, unless sooner terminated, shall terminate at the expiration or termination of the Term of this Agreement.
   - Customer may terminate this Agreement, in whole or in part as to any SOW or portion thereof, for convenience and without cause at any time by giving Provider at least * prior written notice designating the termination date (the “Termination for Convenience Effective Date”), in which event this Agreement or the relevant SOW (or portion thereof) shall terminate as if the date so specified were the originally scheduled date of termination. In the event that a purported termination for cause by Customer under Section 22.1 is determined by a competent authority not to be properly a termination for cause, then such termination by Customer shall be deemed to be a termination for convenience with adequate prior notice under this Section 3.3. In the event of a termination by Customer for convenience pursuant to this Section 3.3, then Customer shall pay to Provider a termination fee, for each SOW or portion thereof so terminated under Section 3.3, determined as follows (the “Termination for Convenience Fee”):
   - In the event that the Customer-designated Termination for Convenience Effective Date takes place before the end of * set forth in each SOW or portion thereof so terminated under Section 3.3 for the Service(s) that are the subject of Customer’s termination for convenience notice (the “Terminated Services”) then the Termination for Convenience Fee shall be equal to the amount of fees Customer paid or has become obligated to pay to Provider for those Terminated Services under the Agreement for the * period immediately preceding the Termination for Convenience Effective Date; provided, however, that if Customer has paid or become obligated to pay less than * of fees immediately preceding the Termination for Convenience Effective Date, then the Termination for Convenience Fee shall be equal to the aggregate amount of fees that Customer paid or became obligated to pay to Provider for those Terminated Services as to each * for which fees were paid or became payable for the * after the relevant SS Commencement Date plus a projected amount based on the average * amount of the fees paid or payable for the * during the period when fees were in fact paid for each additional * necessary to bring the total number of * for which the Termination for Convenience Fee is paid to *.
   - The number of * for which the Termination for Convenience Fee described in Section 3.3.1 above shall be payable shall decrease by * and on each successive * of the relevant SS Commencement Date after a Termination for Convenience Effective Date takes place. For example, if a Customer-designated Termination for Convenience Effective Date takes place between the * of the relevant SS Commencement Date, then the Termination for Convenience Fee shall be equal to the amount of fees Customer paid or became obligated to pay to Provider for the Terminated Services under the Agreement during the * immediately preceding the applicable Termination for Convenience Effective Date, and, if the Termination for Convenience Effective Date takes place between the * of the relevant SS Commencement Date, then the Termination for Convenience Fee shall be equal to the amount of fees Customer paid or became obligated to pay to Provider for the Terminated Services under the Agreement during the * immediately preceding the Termination for Convenience Effective Date, with the * reductions to continue in a like manner, except that in no event shall the Termination for Convenience Fee be less than * fees paid or payable by Customer to Provider, irrespective of the Termination for Convenience Effective Date.
   - In the event of a De Facto Termination for Convenience (as such term is defined below) by Customer, Customer shall pay a Termination for Convenience Fee based on when the Termination for Convenience Effective Date takes place as provided in Sections 3.3.1 through 3.3.2 above only for the average * shortfall of those Services or category of Services under a given SOW that are considered to have suffered a De Facto Termination for Convenience (i.e., the volume of Services terminated beyond the * threshold described below). For purposes of this Section 3.3.3, a “De Facto Termination for Convenience” means a sustained decrease over each of * following the SS Commencement Date in the volume of one or more Services under a given SOW for which Customer is obligated to pay (based on the number of transactions available for Provider to perform) that is greater than * of the * average of the same over the * immediately preceding the period of decreased volume. For example, if the * average volume of transactions during months * following the * of the relevant SS Commencement Date is * transactions and the volume of transactions that Customer makes available to Provider to perform during months * is *, respectively, then Customer shall be deemed to have committed a De Facto Termination for Convenience for exceeding the * variance threshold of * transactions (* % of *) for * and shall be obligated to pay Provider a Termination for Convenience Fee equal to * worth of fees associated with the average * shortfall of * transactions. Notwithstanding the foregoing, under no circumstances shall Customer be deemed to have committed a De Facto Termination for Convenience if Provider is otherwise able to redeploy the Provider Personnel who would otherwise have been idled by the shortfall in volume of Services required to perform other Services on behalf of Customer. In addition, for purposes of clarification and to avoid any misunderstanding, any portion of a Service for which Customer is obligated to pay (even if such Service is not utilized) shall not constitute a shortfall and applied in determining whether the * variance threshold has been exceeded or the amount of the Termination for Convenience Fee for a De Facto Termination for Convenience.
   - Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 3.3, in the event that in any * during the Initial Term, Customer demands, and Provider meets such demand for, a Major Increase (as such Term is defined below) in Services, then the formula for determining the applicable Termination for Convenience Fee shall “reset” and revert to the amount specified in Section 3.3.1, as may be subsequently reduced by * fees for the Terminated Service each year thereafter as provided in Section 3.3.2. For purposes of this Section 3.3.4, a “Major Increase” means a sustained increase in the volume of a Service demanded by Customer after the relevant SS Commencement Date during each of * that is greater than * of the * average over the * immediately preceding the period of increased volume, which increase requires Provider to incur additional capital costs and/or enter into additional binding commitments in order to meet Customer’s demands that, in aggregate, exceed by more than * the pre-existing costs or commitments incurred by Provider immediately prior to Customer’s demand for such Major Increase.'

Clause: '3. **Services**
   - Provider will provide to Customer, and Customer will receive from Provider, the Services specified in this Agreement and the Statements of Work.
   - The Services will be implemented and will commence in accordance with the terms set forth on Schedule 4.2 attached hereto and the applicable SOW.
   - If any services, functions or responsibilities not specifically described in this Agreement are required for the proper performance and provision of the Services, they shall be deemed to be implied by and included within the scope of the Services to the same extent and in the same manner as if specifically described in this Agreement; provided, however, if such Implied Services will cause Provider to incur a Significant Cost Increase, then Provider shall be entitled to submit a written request to the JSC and/or the Governance Board for Customer to provide additional compensation to Provider for such additional costs. Failure by Provider to submit such written request prior to its incurring such additional costs shall constitute a waiver by Provider of its right to seek additional compensation therefor. If the JSC and the Governance Board fail to agree on the resolution of such request, then it may be submitted to dispute resolution in accordance with Article 24 of this Agreement.
   - Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement, Provider shall be responsible for providing all of the resources necessary to provide the Services, including, without limitation, facilities, personnel, software and equipment. In this regard, Provider shall maintain the Equipment and Software used to provide the Services, including (a) maintaining Equipment in good operating condition; (b) undertaking repairs and preventive maintenance on Equipment in accordance with the applicable Equipment manufacturer’s recommendations; and (c) performing Software maintenance, other than with respect to Customer Software maintained by Customer, in accordance with the applicable Software vendor’s documentation and recommendations. Further, Provider agrees to maintain the compatibility of the Equipment, Provider Software, Licensed Software, and other technologies used by Provider in performing the Services (and for which Provider is responsible) with those used by Customer in order for Provider to provide, and Customer to utilize, the Services.
   - Either Party may request a change in or addition to the scope, processes, service levels, service recipients, implementation plan or other changes to a SOW (each, a “Change”), but except as provided in Section 4.5.3, no Change shall be effective and binding unless such Change has been documented in a written change of control document and signed by an Authorized Representative of each Party (each, a “Change Order”). Each Change Order shall be substantially in the form contained in Schedule 4.5 hereto, depending on the nature of the Change. If either Party desires to propose a Change, such Party shall deliver to the relevant Account Manager of the other Party a change request in writing, describing the Change(s) proposed. The Party receiving the request shall respond within ten (10) days following its receipt thereof. If the receiving Party is amenable to the change request, it shall notify the requesting Party, and the requesting Party shall submit a Change Order in draft form for the consideration and approval of the other Party. A Change Order shall include, among other items as appropriate, an estimate of additional or reduced charges to Customer, if applicable, any additional equipment or software or other material required to implement the Change and any expected impact on the project schedule or service-levels under the applicable SOW. Upon execution, including signature by an Authorized Representative of each Party, the Change Order shall become effective and the applicable SOW shall be deemed to have been amended by the Change Order. If the Parties are unable to agree on a Change, then the issue may be referred by the requesting Party to the JSC for resolution.
   - Without limiting the generality of Section 4.5.1 above, the Change Order procedures provided in Section 4.5.1 shall also apply to (i) any requested modification, amendment or alteration to any Administrative Manual practice or procedure that does not qualify as a Minor Administrative Manual Practice or Procedure, (ii) any acknowledgement of the achievement of a SOW milestone event (e.g. the RU Commencement Date and the SS Commencement Date) and (iii) any acknowledgement of the occurrence of an operational event that results in the assessment of a SLA Credit or SLA Bonus, as the case may be, or relieves either Party of its obligations hereunder such as a Relief Event for a Force Majeure Event.
   - Any changes to the legal, regulatory or Payor contract requirements that Provider is required to meet pursuant to the terms of this Agreement shall not be dependent on the execution and approval of a Change Order and shall be effective upon the date of receipt by Provider of written notice thereof signed by an Authorized Representative of Customer, unless such written notice provides for a later effective date; provided that such changes shall still be reviewed and memorialized by the JSC in accordance with the Change Order procedures set forth in Section 4.5.1 above.
   - Any requested modification, amendment or alteration to any term of this Agreement shall be subject to the terms set forth in Section 26.15 below.
   - Notwithstanding Sections 4.5.1 and 4.5.2 above, the Parties’ designated Account Managers may jointly recommend approval of modifications, amendments or alterations to Minor Administrative Manual Practices or Procedures, which recommendations, if adopted, will take immediate effect; provided, however, that such modifications, amendments or alterations cannot and shall not amend or waive any provision of this Agreement or any portion hereof and the effectiveness of such modifications, amendments or alterations may be suspended or nullified by the JSC at any time. For purposes of this Section 4.5, a “Minor Administrative Manual Practice or Procedure” change shall mean a change that does not (i) significantly alter the existing work flow currently in process (i.e. the change does not have any impact on the productivity and average handling time of the process), (ii) alter existing technology currently deployed for the process, and (iii) have any impact on the number of resources (agents and/ or supervisors) required to run the process after the change—including additional resources that may be required to manage any associated regulatory or compliance related requirements that may be a result of such change. In addition, for the sake of clarity, operationally, a Minor Administrative Manual Practice or Procedure change should result in simple dissemination of information to Provider Personnel by either the supervisors and/ or trainers on the process floor, and should not require more than one (1) hour of additional training of such Provider Personnel.
   - For the avoidance of doubt, as noted in Section 4.5.2 above, any requested modification, amendment or alteration to any Administrative Manual practice or procedure other than as specified in Section 4.5.3 that does not qualify as a Minor Administrative Manual Practice or Procedure shall be required to follow the Change Order procedures set forth in this Section 4.5 and memorialized using the Change Order forms set out in Schedule 4.5 hereto.
   - As of the Effective Date, Provider shall provide the Services to Customer, to Customer’s Affiliates, and on Customer’s behalf to those entities to whom and under circumstances similar to those under which services similar to the Services were being provided immediately prior to the Effective Date (collectively “Service Recipients”); provided, however, that any Services provided to Customer’s Affiliates or entities designated by Customer shall be pursuant to a separate SOW that takes into account the additional costs, if any, associated with the provision of the Services to such third parties. At Customer’s option, Provider shall also perform the Services for the following, which, during such extended period of time as follows, shall be deemed to be “Service Recipients”, provided that such extended period shall not continue beyond the Term of this Agreement: (i) an entity which is an Affiliate of Customer shall continue to receive the Services for up to * (and longer if agreed by the Parties) after the date it ceases to be controlled by Customer; (ii) the purchaser of all or substantially all the assets of any line of business of Customer or its Affiliates shall continue to receive Services for up to * (and longer if agreed by the Parties) after the date of purchase, but only with respect to the business acquired. During the Term, Provider shall also provide the Services on Customer’s behalf to such other entities (e.g., doctors, hospitals, home care and home medical equipment companies, and other medical institutions) as Customer may designate from time to time. Notwithstanding the previous sentence, Customer may utilize the Services in support of or as part of Customer’s business operations and offerings, provided that if Customer requires use of the Services in connection with entities that are not Service Recipients and not Customer Affiliates and as a result Provider would incur additional costs to a third party (e.g., additional third party license fees) in an amount representing a Significant Cost Increase, then there will be an equitable adjustment to the charges to accommodate such costs as herein provided.
   - If Customer Directs Provider to provide the Services to an entity pursuant to Section 4.6.1(ii) above and such entity is a Competitor, then Customer shall be deemed to have waived Provider’s compliance with the non-competition obligations under Section 25 below solely with respect to the acquired business. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a purchaser of all or substantially all the assets of any line of business of Customer or its Affiliates seeks to novate the applicable SOW, then Provider will negotiate such novation in good faith.
   - For purposes of this Agreement, (i) the Services provided to the entities referenced in this Section 4.6 shall be deemed to be Services provided to Customer and (ii) all references to “Customer” with respect to receipt of the Services shall be deemed to include the entities referenced in this Section 4.6.'

Clause: '4. **Project and Contract Management**
   - The Parties shall form a Governance Board to establish and resolve major policy decisions concerning operations under this Agreement, consider requests for Changes and any other matters relating to this Agreement, any SOW and the operations of the Parties affected thereby which are not resolved by the JSC. The Governance Board shall be comprised of two representatives. One representative shall be designated by Provider and one representative shall be designated by Customer. Upon execution of this Agreement, the initial Customer Governance Board representative shall be *, and the initial Provider Governance Board representative shall be *, each of whom shall have full authority to act on behalf of Provider but collectively shall count as a single representative. Thereafter, each Party shall notify the other in writing as to changes in its appointee to the Governance Board. Each such appointee shall serve at the pleasure of the appointing Party. A Party may designate a substitute representative in the event that a designated representative is unable to attend or participate in a Governance Board meeting. All decisions of the Governance Board, whether reached by consensus or by the decision of the Customer representative on the Board as provided below, shall be final and binding upon the Parties.
   - The Governance Board shall convene in person or by electronic means as necessary, but no less than once every six (6) months, for purposes related to the administration of this Agreement and the Services provided hereunder, including oversight and monitoring of compliance with Performance Standards, promulgating and implementing necessary amendments to this Agreement or any SOW, resolution of disputes between the Parties that have reached impasse at the JSC level and other matters related to the administration of this Agreement. All meetings of the Governance Board shall be held during U.S. Business Hours on a Business Day as agreed by the Parties, or on no less than three (3) Business Days’ prior written notice if the Parties do not agree otherwise.
   - The Parties desire that decisions of the Governance Board be reached by consensus, if possible. However, if the members of the Governance Board are unable to agree, Customer’s representative on the Governance Board shall be entitled to make the determination on behalf of the Governance Board unilaterally and, if necessary, to amend this Agreement and any SOW accordingly and impose any policy or procedure subject only to the restrictions set forth in Section 5.1.4 below.
   - Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 5.1.3 above, Customer shall not be entitled to impose any amendment to this Agreement, policy or procedure which (i) would cause Provider to be in violation of any applicable law, regulation, or insurance requirement, any agreement entered into in good faith with a third party on an arm’s length basis for purposes not relating to the evasion of this Agreement, or any order of a court or other judicial body to which Provider is or may become subject, or (ii) would unreasonably interfere with Provider’s ability to perform its obligations hereunder. In addition, if any such action on Customer’s part is not provided for in this Agreement or in any applicable SOWs in effect immediately prior to such action, and such action would cause Provider to incur a Significant Cost Increase, then Provider shall be entitled to request the JSC and/or the Governance Board to determine whether Provider is entitled to any additional compensation for its additional costs. If the matter can not be resolved by the JSC or Governance Board, then it may be submitted to dispute resolution in accordance with Article 24 of this Agreement.
   - The Parties shall form a JSC to facilitate communications between them and establish policies and procedures governing the operations of the Parties under this Agreement and any SOWs. The JSC shall be composed of a senior management representative of both Customer and Provider, and such other persons as may be mutually agreed by the Parties, with both Parties to be equally represented. The JSC shall provide general oversight and guidance to the Parties, including serving as the arbiter with respect to issues arising during and from meetings, committees, and work groups formed by the Parties (e.g., change request, reliability, service and performance issues). Upon execution of this Agreement, the initial Customer JSC representatives shall be *; and the initial Provider JSC representatives shall be *, as a non-voting representative. Thereafter, each Party shall notify the other in writing as to changes in its representatives to the JSC. Each such representative shall serve at the pleasure of the designating Party. A Party may (a) designate a substitute representative in the event that a designated representative is unable to participate in a JSC meeting and (b) assign the vote of a representative unable to attend a JSC meeting to a representative who is able to participate in that JSC meeting.
   - The JSC shall be responsible for overseeing day-to-day matters in connection with the Services, and shall report to, and be subject to the authority of, the Governance Board.
   - The JSC shall convene in person or by electronic means as necessary, but no less than quarterly (unless both Parties agree in writing that a particular quarterly meeting is unnecessary), to consider and address such implementation, administration and performance issues as they may deem appropriate, resolve requests for Changes pursuant to Section 4.5, coordinate the performance of each Party’s duties and obligations, and address any issues of common concern. The JSC shall notify the Governance Board of any issue which has or is likely to have significant impact, or be of major concern, or with regard to which the JSC has been unable to reach a decision. Either Customer or Provider may call for a special meeting of the JSC, and add any issue of concern to the committee agenda. The JSC shall maintain a record of the issues considered and any decisions reached, and such decisions, as appropriate, shall be set forth in consecutively numbered amendments or Change Orders to this Agreement or applicable SOWS, as appropriate. The JSC may designate one of its members to serve as the chairperson of the committee for purposes of maintaining records, calling and noticing meetings, and performing necessary administrative functions required by the committee.
   - Each Party’s designees to the JSC shall have the knowledge, authority, and responsibility in respect to the Services such as to enable the JSC to make necessary and appropriate decisions to implement this Agreement and any SOW and to resolve any matters needing to be resolved at the operational level. Decisions of the JSC shall be made by the affirmative vote of no less than * of the total JSC members, with at least one affirmative vote being that of a representative of Customer and at least one affirmative vote being that of a representative of Provider. In the event that the JSC fails to resolve an issue, either Party may request that it be referred to the Governance Board for resolution.
   - Each Party shall designate an “Account Manager” who shall be the principal point of contact between the Parties for all matters relating to Services provided under a particular SOW. Each SOW shall contain initial designation of an Account Manager for each Party. A Party may designate a new Account Manager by written notice to the other Party. Any changes in the Account Manager shall be notified to the other Party in advance. A Party may, in its sole discretion, designate the same individual as its Account Manager under more than one SOW.
   - During the Term, the Parties shall hold such meetings, and Provider shall deliver to Customer such reports as are described in Schedule 5.4 hereto.
   - Provider shall perform all Services in accordance with the procedures set forth in Schedule 5.5 attached hereto or in the Administrative Manual, any policies or procedures adopted by the JSC or Governance Board and those listed in the applicable SOW.'

Clause: '5. **Customer’s Obligations**
   - Customer acknowledges and agrees that there may be instances in which Provider will be unable to perform the Services without assistance from Customer. Consequently, Customer will provide to Provider, in a timely manner, such resources specified in each SOW, to enable Provider to perform the Services. Examples of such resources may include connectivity support, documentation, knowledge base, hardware, software, support personnel and trainers. Failure of Customer to provide any such assistance or resources specified in the applicable SOW will not constitute a breach by Customer or Customer Default but will merely be a Relief Event to the extent, and only for so long as, such failure persists and actually causes Provider to be unable or impairs Provider’s ability to provide the affected Services. Provider shall be obligated to perform any Services which are unaffected by such failure on the part of Customer, and Provider shall continue to provide even affected Services to the maximum extent that it is feasible to do so. Any resources not specifically identified in a SOW as Customer’s responsibility to obtain or provide shall be deemed to be Provider’s responsibility.
   - Customer acknowledges and agrees that Provider is relying on the accuracy of the written information and Directions supplied by Customer, and other requirements specified by Customer in writing (cumulatively, the “Processing Norms”), to perform the Services. In the event the Processing Norms are not accurate or are found to be inadequate, the Party discovering such fact shall promptly notify the other Party of any such deficiency and the Parties shall cooperate with each other to remedy the situation in a timely manner. So long as Provider is not otherwise aware of or does not have any reason to believe the Processing Norms supplied by Customer are inaccurate or inadequate or, if Provider is aware of or has reason to believe the Processing Norms supplied by Customer are inaccurate or inadequate, notifies Customer in writing of such fact, Provider shall (i) be entitled to rely on and act in accordance with the Processing Norms, (ii) not incur any liability for claims, losses or damages that arise as a result of Provider’s compliance with the Processing Norms and (iii) be entitled to payment for its performance, and be excused from its poor performance or non-performance of, the Services, to the extent Provider’s performance is predominantly affected by such inaccurate Processing Norms supplied by Customer.
   - Customer grants, or will arrange for third party licensors to grant, to Provider a limited, non-exclusive license to access and use the Customer Software and the Licensed Software in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth on Schedule 6.3 hereto, as they may be amended by Customer or the third party licensors from time to time solely in connection with the performance of Provider’s obligations under this Agreement and under any applicable SOW.
   - Customer hereby grants to Provider a limited non-exclusive license to use Customer Marks solely in connection with the performance of Provider’s obligations under this Agreement, including the right to use Customer’s name over the telephone, the internet and in written materials in performing the Services. Such use of Customer Marks must conform to any written instructions provided by Customer to Provider in this regard, as may be further specified in the applicable SOW. Customer has the right to require Provider to furnish from time to time samples of Provider’s use of Customer Marks.'

Clause: '7. **Business Continuity / Disaster Recovery**
   - The Parties recognize that the Services are vital to Customer’s business and, therefore, it is of paramount importance to Customer that Provider’s provision of the Services remain continuous and disruption-free. In the event Provider’s provision of the Services is disrupted for any reason, it is of corresponding importance to Customer that they be restored rapidly and in a manner that minimizes the impact on Customer’s operations and business. Accordingly, Provider agrees to undertake the business continuity / disaster recovery steps described below and in Schedule 8.1 hereto.
   - During the Term of this Agreement, Provider shall maintain the capabilities and follow the recovery strategies and other measures set forth in Provider’s standard Business Continuity Plan / Disaster Recovery Plan as attached hereto as Schedule 8.1. To the extent requested by Customer, the Parties will work together to modify or supplement such Plan as it pertains to the Services offered under a SOW and include such modified or supplementary plans in such SOW along with any incremental costs associated therewith. Any change to the Business Continuity Plan / Disaster Recovery Plan under any SOW shall be subject to review and approval by the Governance Board. All Business Continuity Plans / Disaster Recovery Plans shall, among other things, specify the alternative location or facility from which the said Services will be rendered.
   - Provider shall familiarize all Provider Personnel with and train Key Provider Personnel in the recovery strategies and procedures set forth in the relevant Business Continuity Plan / Disaster Recovery Plan, particularly as they relate to disaster prevention measures, alternative means of operation and the notification process.
   - If a Provider Facility becomes unavailable (and subject to the applicable disaster recovery provisions of this Agreement and the relevant SOW) or Provider’s ability to provide the Services therefrom is significantly impaired, it is contemplated that Provider will shift some or all of the work to the second Provider Facility from which the Service is provided. If an additional and temporary facility is required in order to provide the Services, the Parties agree that:
     - The charges payable by Customer for the Services provided from the temporary Provider Facility shall be at the same rate as if such Services were being provided prior to the disaster event at the originally planned Facility (i.e., as if such Services were being provided from the now-unavailable Provider Facility);
     - The Services shall be provided from the temporary Provider Facility only for such time as the recovery requires and until the original Provider Facility can be rendered fit for providing the Services; and
     - If the original Provider Facility is permanently unavailable, a permanent site shall be reasonably proposed by Provider and subject to Customer’s approval. Provider’s Disaster Recovery Plan shall specify the location of any back-up facilities.'

Clause: '8. **Compliance with Laws**
   - Each Party shall perform its obligations in a manner that complies with all applicable federal, state, provincial and local laws, regulations, ordinances and codes of the United States and India (including but not limited to the FTC “Red Flags Rules” relating to identity theft prevention as set forth in 16 C.F.R. Part 681), which compliance shall include identifying and procuring required permits, certificates, approvals and inspections. Provider shall be responsible for implementation of, and shall implement, all health care legal and regulatory mandates, including, without limitation, Medicaid Regulations and Medicare Regulations and Payor contract requirements relating to Provider’s performance hereunder, to the extent provided by and Directed by Customer. If a charge occurs of noncompliance of a Party with any such laws, regulations, ordinances or codes, the Party so charged shall promptly notify the other Party of such charges in writing.
   - Provider shall post notices at the Provider Facilities notifying Provider Personnel of (i) their ongoing obligation to report immediately any fraudulent conduct or any violation or suspected violation of any ethical and/or regulatory requirements to the following website, www.ethicspoint.com, and (ii) that any reporting Personnel complying with such obligation will be protected from retribution of any kind;
   - Similarly, Provider shall have an affirmative duty to notify Customer promptly in writing if Provider becomes aware or otherwise has reason to believe that any such violation has occurred and to identify all Provider Personnel involved with such incident, even if Provider believes the situation has been corrected and/or has already taken all necessary corrective actions. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, Customer shall have the right to require Provider to immediately suspend or remove any such Provider Personnel from the provision of the Services to Customer; and
   - Provider shall take all necessary steps to protect any Provider Personnel who report fraudulent conduct or violations of ethical or regulatory requirements in accordance with Section 9.2.1 above from any direct or indirect harassment or retribution of any kind. Except with the prior written consent of Customer, Provider shall not disclose or attempt to determine or divulge the identity of any such Provider Personnel or attempt to investigate the alleged incident independently.

If at any time during the Term, Customer determines on the basis of reasonable evidence that the foregoing warranty is materially inaccurate, then Customer shall notify Provider in writing of the fact that it has made such a determination and of the evidence upon which the determination was based. Provider shall have ten (10) days following receipt of such notification within which Provider may present Customer with any information or evidence Provider may have indicating that Customer’s determination was incorrect, and Customer agrees to consider any such information provided. However, if, after the expiration of such ten (10) day period, Customer nevertheless determines, in its sole discretion that its initial determination was correct, then Customer, in addition to any other rights Customer may have at law or in equity, shall have the right and option to terminate this Agreement for cause pursuant to Section 22.1.1.2 and without cost, without affording Provider any further opportunity to cure.
      - Restricted or Excluded Parties. Provider represents that neither Provider, nor any officer or director of Provider, is a Restricted Party or an Excluded Party and that Provider shall not utilize, employ or subcontract with any Restricted Party or Excluded Party in the performance of the Services hereunder. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, if Customer determines that Provider, or any officer or director of Provider, or employee or subcontractor of Provider performing any portion of the Services hereunder, is, or becomes, a Restricted Party or an Excluded Party during the Term, then Provider shall be deemed to have committed a default hereunder, and Customer, in addition to and without waiving any other right or remedy it may have for such default, may terminate this Agreement immediately pursuant to Section 22.1.1.2.
      - Viruses. Provider shall use commercially reasonable efforts so that no Viruses are coded or introduced into the systems used to provide the Services. “Virus” shall mean (a) program code or programming instruction or set of instructions intentionally designed to disrupt, disable, harm, interfere with or otherwise adversely affect computer programs, data files or operations; or (b) other code typically described as a virus or by similar terms, including Trojan horse, worm or backdoor. Virus does not include Disabling Code (as such term is defined below).
        - In the event a Virus is found to have been introduced into the systems used to provide the Services, Provider shall (i) provide all cooperation and assistance reasonably requested by Customer or the JSC to (including assisting Customer in its efforts to) eliminate the effects of the Virus, and (ii) if the Virus causes a loss of operational efficiency or loss of data, assist Customer to the same extent to mitigate and restore such losses.
        - In the event that a Virus is introduced by a Customer system, Provider’s efforts as provided in Section 17.3.8.1: (i) shall be at no additional charge to Customer, to the extent available Provider Personnel are utilized, and (ii) shall be at Customer’s cost, to the extent additional resources are utilized, provided that Customer shall have the right to approve use of all such additional resources. Under these circumstances, additional resources shall not include Provider’s general support personnel but shall include personnel reassigned by Provider from the servicing of other specific accounts. In addition, Provider shall be excused from meeting required service levels to the extent that problems caused by the virus impair Provider’s ability to perform.
        - In the event that a Virus is introduced by a Provider system: (i) Provider’s efforts as set forth in Section 17.3.8.1 shall be at no additional charge to Customer; (ii) Provider shall engage additional resources, at Provider’s cost, as necessary; (iii) Provider shall not be excused with respect to any required service levels affected, unless Provider’s efforts to meet such affected service levels would cause or allow the Virus to spread, and (iv) Provider shall pay to Customer an amount equal to all of Customer’s costs of any data restoration, the cost to Customer of any business disruption, and any other losses or liabilities of Customer resulting from such Virus.
      - Disabling Code. Without the prior written consent of Customer, Provider shall not insert into any of the Software any code which would have the effect of disabling or otherwise shutting down all or any portion of the Services (“Disabling Code”); provided, however, that “Disabling Code” shall not include programming code, programming instruction or set of instructions that is distributed as part of hardware or software to ensure that the purchaser or licensee uses the product in accordance with the acquisition or license agreement (such code “Commercially-Provided Disabling Code”) and which Software already contains such Commercially-Provided Disabling Code. Provider further represents and warrants that, with respect to any Disabling Code and Commercially-Provided Disabling Code that may be part of any Software, Provider shall not invoke such Disabling Code or Commercially-Provided Disabling Code at any time, including upon expiration or termination of this Agreement for any reason, without Customer’s prior written consent.
