1. SERVICES.
-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-

2. FEES.
2.1 Fees and Expenses. As compensation for EVERSANA’s performance of the Services, Client shall pay fees and expenses (“Fees”) in accordance with the applicable SOW, including any initial one-time set-up fee as described in the applicable SOW. Client shall reimburse EVERSANA for reasonable and properly documented out-of-pocket expenses necessarily incurred in performing Services under this Agreement as the same shall be set forth in a SOW.
-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-

2.2 Fee Increases. On each twelve-month anniversary of the Effective Date, EVERSANA shall have the right to unilaterally increase any then-current transaction or monthly fees for the Services provided under a SOW by [***] percent ([***]%).
-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-

2.3 Invoices. On a monthly basis, or as may be otherwise set forth in a SOW, EVERSANA shall submit an invoice setting forth the Services performed, time expended and expenses incurred during the applicable period with respect to each active SOW. Client agrees to pay EVERSANA within [***] days of receipt of each monthly invoice, or as otherwise set forth in a SOW, and agrees EVERSANA may charge Client a one-and-one-half percent (1.5%) per month service charge, or the maximum rate allowed by law, whichever is less, on all undisputed invoices that are not paid within [***] days of receipt. Notwithstanding the foregoing, pass through expenses incurred pursuant to a SOW will be billed as incurred. The Fees accrued during the period between the Effective Date and March 31, 2021 shall be deferred (the "Deferred Fees"). Upon the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s approval of an Emergency Use Authorization (“EUA”) for Client’s COVID-19 Product, EVERSANA will invoice Client for the Deferred Fees (the “Initial Invoice”).
-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-

2.4 Disputed Fees. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Client disputes any charges or amounts on any invoice, and such dispute cannot be resolved promptly through good faith discussions between Client and EVERSANA, then Client will pay the amount of the invoice less the disputed amount, provided that Client shall diligently proceed to work with EVERSANA to resolve any such disputed amount. Any sums withheld pursuant to this paragraph shall not accrue service charges, but if the contested invoice is later determined to be valid in amount, Client shall pay the amount withheld.
-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-

2.5 Effect of Failure to Pay. In the event that any invoice, other than the amount of any disputed charges or amounts reflected on such invoice, is not timely paid as provided herein, EVERSANA may, in addition to any other right or remedy that it may have under this Agreement or at law, suspend Client’s use of any Services provided hereunder or under any SOW if EVERSANA has not received payment in full within [***] days of EVERSANA’s written demand for payment of the undisputed amount of such invoice.
-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-

3. TERM AND TERMINATION.
The initial term of this Agreement begins on the Effective Date and shall continue for a period of one (1) years (“Initial Term”). After the Initial Term this Agreement shall automatically renew for successive twelve (12) month periods (“Term”) unless this Agreement and/or any SOW hereunder is sooner terminated by either party as provided herein or at least [***] days prior to the end of the then-current renewal period, either party gives the other party written notice of termination. In addition, after the expiration of the Initial Term, Client shall be permitted to terminate this Agreement and/or any SOW upon at least [***] days’ prior written notice of termination to EVERSANA.
-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-

3.1 Termination for Lack of Approval. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event the FDA does not approve an EUA for the Product by April 30, 2021 or such later date as to which the parties otherwise may agree, either party may terminate the Agreement immediately. In the event of a termination pursuant to this Section 3.1, EVERSANA shall cancel the Initial Invoice and Client shall not be required to pay any of the Deferred Fees.
-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-

3.2 Change in Law. This Agreement may be terminated by either party giving written notice of termination to the other party if there is any change in the law that makes operation of the Services as contemplated in this Agreement illegal or commercially impractical.
-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-

3.3 Material Breach. This Agreement may be terminated by the non-breaching party giving written notice of such termination to the other party if the other party breaches a material provision of this Agreement and such breach remains uncured for thirty (30) days.
-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-

3.4 Insolvency. Immediately upon notification or at any time thereafter, either party may terminate this Agreement in the event that:
(i) the other party shall file any petition under any bankruptcy, reorganization, insolvency or moratorium laws, or any other law or laws for the relief of or in relation to the relief of debtors;
(ii) there shall be filed against the other party any involuntary petition under any bankruptcy statute or a receiver or trustee shall be appointed to take possession of all or substantial part of the assets of the party which has not been dismissed or terminated within ninety (90) days of the date of such filing or appointment;
(iii) the other party shall make a general assignment for the benefit of creditors or shall become unable or admit in writing its inability to meet its obligations as they mature; or
(iv) the other party shall institute any proceedings for liquidation or the winding up of its business other than for purposes of reorganization, consolidation or merger.
-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-

3.5 Effect of Termination. Termination or expiration of this Agreement for any reason provided herein does not relieve either party from its obligation to perform up to the effective date of such termination or expiration or to perform such obligations as may survive termination or expiration of this Agreement. If payments attributable to Services performed before the termination or expiration remain unpaid upon the termination or expiration of the Agreement, Client shall make such payments promptly after the termination or expiration of this Agreement. In the event of termination, EVERSANA will use reasonable efforts to terminate work being performed by firms outside of EVERSANA (e.g. subcontracted resources) and other related commitments entered into by EVERSANA but Client will be responsible for all costs incurred by EVERSANA from such other firms and such other commitments approved by Client that could not be terminated. Client will be responsible for all EVERSANA time and expenses for Services performed up to date of termination. Upon the termination or expiration of this Agreement or any SOW, EVERSANA shall provide reasonable transition services, for a period not to exceed [***] days, as requested by the Client to facilitate the orderly transfer of Services to Client or another services provider. EVERSANA shall provide the transition services on a time and materials basis at the rates set forth [***].

3.6 Survival. The rights and obligations of the parties under Sections 2, 3.5, 6-9, 12, 14-15, 21-23 and 25 will survive the expiration or termination of this Agreement.

4. NON-ASSIGNMENT.
Neither Client nor EVERSANA shall assign this Master Services Agreement or any of their rights and obligations under this Master Services Agreement to another party without the prior written consent of the other party; provided, however, that in the event of a Change in Control (as defined above), either party may assign its rights and obligations hereunder, by no less than thirty (30) days written notice to the other party, to a successor or transferee (whether by merger, consolidation, purchase or otherwise) of either all or substantially all of the assets of such party or any part of the business to which it pertains. This contract will inure for the benefit of and be binding upon Client and EVERSANA and their respective successors and permitted assigns including, without limitation, any acquirer of either Client or EVERSANA.
-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-

5. FORCE MAJEURE.
Neither party shall be deemed in default in the performance of its obligations under the Agreement to the extent such performance is temporarily prevented or delayed because of war, hostilities, riots, acts of terrorism, civil commotion, epidemic, earthquake, accident, fire, wind, flood, strike or comparable labor shutdowns outside of the reasonable control of the party, or any other act of God; provided that prompt notice of such Force Majeure shall be given by such party to the other party followed within a reasonable time by written confirmation. In such event, the noticing party shall be temporarily relieved of its obligations during the period of such event to the extent such event prevents its performance. If the Force Majeure event continues for one or more related periods of at least sixty (60) days, the other party shall have the unilateral right to terminate this Agreement by fourteen (14) days prior written notice.

6. CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION.
As used in this Agreement, the term “Confidential Information” shall mean any and all trade secrets and other confidential information disclosed by a party or its affiliates, agents, employees and representatives (the “Disclosing Party”). “Confidential Information” shall include, without limitation, any information concerning the Disclosing Party’s business plan, processes and methods, product or process specifications and designs, inventions, technical know-how, trade secrets, business and marketing plans, financial information, customer data, research and development activities and other materials or information relating to its business or activities which are not generally known to the public, all confidential information of third-parties in the possession of the Disclosing Party; and all reports, notes, analyses, compilations, studies, summaries, memoranda and other material prepared by or for the Disclosing Party containing, reflecting or based, in whole or in part, on any information included in the foregoing. For the avoidance of doubt, the parties acknowledge and agree that information and data gathered by the parties relating to patients, including, without limitation, patient numbers, locations and the manner in which Client identified such patients, shall be Client’s Confidential Information and EVERSANA shall be deemed to be the Receiving Party of such Confidential Information regardless of the party that discloses the Confidential Information hereunder. The term “Confidential Information” shall not include any information that is (i) publicly known or becomes publicly known through no breach of this Agreement by the party receiving or accessing the Confidential Information (the “Receiving Party”) or on the Receiving Party’s behalf, (ii) rightfully received from a third party without an obligation of confidentiality to the Disclosing Party with respect to the information received, or (iii) approved by the Disclosing Party for disclosure.
-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-

7. NON-DISCLOSURE.
During the Term of this Agreement and for a period of [***] years (or such longer period if required by law) thereafter, the Receiving Party shall keep the Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information in the strictest confidence (whether such Confidential Information was disclosed to the Receiving Party before, on or after the Effective Date) and shall not disclose, or permit the disclosure of, any Confidential Information to any third party without the prior consent of the Disclosing Party. The Receiving Party shall not use, or permit the use of, any Confidential Information, without the prior consent of the Disclosing Party, for any purpose other than in connection with the proper performance of the Receiving Party’s obligations under this Agreement. The Receiving Party shall use its best efforts to prevent any inadvertent disclosure or unauthorized reproduction or use of the Confidential Information. The Receiving Party shall protect the Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information with no less than the same degree of care as the Receiving Party would protect its own Confidential Information, and in any event, no less than a reasonable degree of care. The Receiving Party shall be liable for breach of its obligations under this Section 7 by its employees and contractors. The Receiving Party will immediately advise the Disclosing Party in writing if the Receiving Party becomes aware of any misappropriation or misuse by any person of the Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Receiving Party may disclose the Confidential Information of the other party to the extent such Confidential Information is required to be disclosed pursuant to a requirement of a Regulatory Authority or law, provided that: (a) the Receiving Party has given the Disclosing Party prior written notice of such disclosure and takes all available steps to maintain the confidentiality of the information disclosed; and (b) to the extent legally permitted, the Disclosing Party has been afforded a reasonable opportunity to contest the necessity and scope of such disclosure. The Receiving Party acknowledges and agrees that the Disclosing Party considers the Confidential Information to be valuable, confidential and a trade secret. Unless otherwise required by law, the Receiving Party shall, at Disclosing Party’s election, destroy (unless prohibited by applicable law) or promptly return to the Disclosing Party, in good order, the originals and all copies of Confidential Information, regardless of the medium in which they are stored, upon the termination or expiration of this Agreement or at any other time upon the reasonable request of the Disclosing Party except for:
a. archival electronic information that is electronically archived in the normal course and not in general use;
b. information which must otherwise be maintained as a requirement of law or regulation; and
c. one (1) copy of the Confidential Information to the extent reasonable to permit the Receiving Party to keep evidence that it has performed its obligations under this Agreement
provided, in each case of clause 7(a) to 7(c), that the confidentiality and non-use restrictions set out in clause 7, shall continue to apply to such Confidential Information, except that the Receiving Party shall not make any further use or disclosure of the Confidential Information.

14. INDEMNIFICATION.
Each party will defend, indemnify and hold harmless the other party, its officers, directors, employees, sublicensees, customers and agents from and against any and all losses, liabilities, damages, expenses and costs (including reasonable attorney’s fees) (“Losses”), including Losses resulting from third party claims, demands, suits or proceedings, to the extent arising out of (i) its negligence, intentional misconduct or bad faith, (ii) any breach of its confidentiality obligations under this Agreement, or (iii) an actual material breach of this Agreement or any Statement of Work on the part of the indemnifying party. EVERSANA will defend, indemnify and hold harmless the Client, its officers, directors, employees, sublicensees, customers and agents from and against any and all Losses resulting from or alleging that any of the Work Product or EVERSANA Property provided by EVERSANA under this Agreement infringes or misappropriates any third-party’s Intellectual Property. Each party will notify the other party promptly upon learning of a claim, demand, suit, or proceeding that might give rise to a Loss, and the potentially indemnifying party may control defense and settlement thereof provided it does so diligently, in good faith, and using reasonably experienced counsel with expertise in the relevant field. The Indemnified Party shall give the Indemnifying Party timely written notice and reasonable cooperation and assistance in the defense of any Losses; provided however, that failure of the Indemnified Party to give such notice shall not limit the Indemnified Party’s right to indemnification except in such case where such failure was known to the Indemnified Party and materially and adversely affects the Indemnifying Party’s ability to defend against such Losses. The potentially indemnified party will reasonably cooperate in such defense and/or settlement at the potentially indemnifying party’s request and expense and may participate at its own expense using its own counsel. In no event shall the Indemnified Party be liable for any claims that are compromised or settled in violation of this Section. In the event of a dispute in connection with the validity of this Section (Indemnification), all costs, fees and expenses, including but not limited to attorneys’ fees, shall be allocated as set forth in Section 12 hereof.
Client shall reimburse EVERSANA for all of the out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including, reasonable attorneys’ fees) incurred by EVERSANA in connection with any of the following events or occurrences, except to the extent that such events or occurrences are caused by gross negligence, bad faith or reckless or intentional misconduct by EVERSANA or a breach by EVERSANA of its express obligations contained in this Agreement: (i) any directed inspection, investigation or inquiry by any regulatory authority attributable to Client or its Products or business practices; or (ii) any court or regulatory authority order, subpoena, interrogatory, demand, request for admission or other process of law directed to EVERSANA and specifically attributable to Client or its Products or business practices; or (iii) any request by Client to produce documentation or information, or give testimony or other services in connection with either (i) or (ii) above.
The parties hereto acknowledge that EVERSANA has not had and will not have any role in the manufacture, labeling, or packaging of Products and that, as between the parties, Client shall have the sole liability for any product liability or similar claims (regardless of the legal theory upon which such claims may be brought) with respect to Products.
Accordingly, except to the extent caused by the gross negligence, bad faith or reckless or intentional misconduct by EVERSANA or a breach by EVERSANA of its express material obligations contained in this Agreement, Client indemnifies and agrees to defend and hold EVERSANA and its members, directors, officers, managers, employees and agents (“EVERSANA Indemnitees”), harmless from any and all third-party claims and resulting damages (whether for bodily injury or death, third-party property damage or otherwise), demands, causes of action, losses, judgments, costs and expenses of any nature whatsoever, including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys’ fees (collectively, “Claims”) to the extent caused by or attributable to:
(i) Any defect(s) in the manufacture of any Product, inherent safety risks of any Product or dangerous side effects of any Product;
(ii) The manufacturing, labeling, and packaging of any Product;
