-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-

6.2 General Confidentiality Obligations. The Confidential Information of a Disclosing Party which is disclosed to a Receiving Party will be held by the Receiving Party in strictest confidence at all times and will not be used by the Receiving Party (or its affiliates or their respective Representatives) for any purpose other than to fulfill its obligations set forth in this Agreement, unless previously authorized by the Disclosing Party in writing. The Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party will not be disclosed or divulged by the Receiving Party to any third party, except with the prior written permission of the Disclosing Party and on the condition that the party to whom the Confidential Information is disclosed agrees to be bound by these terms and conditions. The Receiving Party may disclose the Confidential Information only to those of its (or its affiliates’) employees, vendors, consultants, contractors or advisors who need to review or access the Confidential Information for the purposes authorized by the Disclosing Party but only after the Receiving Party has informed them of the confidential nature of the Confidential Information and such persons have agreed to treat the Confidential Information in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

If no such protective order or other remedy is obtained, or the Disclosing Party waives compliance with the confidentiality obligations of this Agreement and authorizes such disclosure, the Receiving Party will furnish only that portion of the Confidential Information which it is advised by counsel is legally required and will exercise its reasonable efforts to obtain assurance that confidential treatment will be afforded to the Confidential Information.

-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-

7.4 Indemnification Procedures. Any zulily Indemnified Party or Provider Indemnified Party (each an “Indemnified Party”) believing that it is entitled to indemnification under this Agreement will give prompt written notice to Provider or zulily (an “Indemnifying Party”) of the commencement of any Claim for which indemnification may be sought or, if earlier, upon the assertion of any such Claim (it being understood and agreed, however, that the failure of the Indemnified Party to give notice of a Claim as provided in this Section 7.4 will not relieve an Indemnifying Party of its indemnification obligation under this Agreement unless the Indemnifying Party is materially disadvantaged by such delay). Within 30 days after delivery of such notification, the Indemnifying Party will, upon written notice to the Indemnified Party, assume control of the defense of such Claim with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party; provided that the Indemnifying Party has accepted its indemnity and defense obligations without reservation. If the Indemnifying Party has reserved any rights with respect to defense or indemnity, the Indemnified Party will control the defense. If the Indemnifying Party believes that a Claim presented to it for indemnification is one as to which the Indemnified Party is not entitled to indemnification under this Agreement, it will so notify the Indemnified Party on a prompt basis (but in no event later than 30 days after delivery of notification of the Claim). The Indemnified Party may participate in such defense at its own expense; provided that if the Indemnified Party reasonably concludes, based on advice from counsel, that the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party have conflicting interests with respect to such Claim, the Indemnifying Party will be responsible for the reasonable fees and expenses of independent counsel to the Indemnified Party. The Indemnifying Party will keep the Indemnified Party advised of the status of such Claim and the defense thereof and will consider recommendations made by the Indemnified Party with respect thereto. The Indemnified Party will not agree to any settlement of such Claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party. The Indemnifying Party will not agree to any settlement of such Claim or consent to any judgment in respect thereof that does not include a complete and unconditional release of any Indemnified Party from all liability with respect thereto or that imposes any liability or obligation on the Indemnified Party or adversely affects the Indemnified Party without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party.
-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-
