3. NON-EXCLUSIVITY. The Parties agree expressly that this Agreement shall be non-exclusive with respect to each Party and that, accordingly, (a) Service Provider may from time to time render similar advice and services to other companies; and (b) any Service Recipient may from time to time retain similar advice and services from other parties.
-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-

4. CONFIDENTIALITY.
   (a) Service Recipients and Service Provider each acknowledge and agree that all documents, instruments, records, reports and information (regardless of how embodied or conveyed) which are received from the other Party during the Term (collectively, “Confidential Information”) are highly confidential and shall be maintained in strict confidence. Accordingly, each of the Service Recipients and Service Provider agrees that it shall not, at any time during or after the expiration of this Agreement, use in a manner unauthorized by the disclosing Party, any Confidential Information of the disclosing Party or, without the prior written consent of the disclosing Party, directly or indirectly disclose any such Confidential Information to any other Person, other than to any Affiliate, provided that the receiving Party shall require the same agreement from such Affiliate to whom Confidential Information is disclosed.
   (b) The term “Confidential Information” does not include any data or information which the receiving Party can establish is already known to the receiving Party at the time it was initially disclosed to the receiving Party. Furthermore, the term “Confidential Information” does not include any data or information which before being divulged by the receiving Party, the receiving Party can establish (a) has become generally known to the public through no wrongful act of the receiving Party or breach of its obligations under this Agreement; (b) has been rightfully received by the receiving Party from a third party without restriction on disclosure and without, to the knowledge of the receiving Party, a breach of an obligation of confidentiality running directly or indirectly to the disclosing Party; or (c) has been approved for release by a written authorization by the disclosing Party.
   (c) In the event that the receiving Party is legally requested or required (by oral questions, interrogatories, requests for information or documents, subpoena, civil investigative demand or similar process, or, in the opinion of counsel for such Party, by federal or state securities or other statutes, regulations, or laws) to disclose any Confidential Information, such Party shall, to the extent practicable without violation of applicable legal requirements, promptly notify the disclosing Party of such requests or requirement prior to disclosure so that the disclosing Party may, at its expense, seek an appropriate protective order and/or waive compliance with the terms of this Agreement.

5. INDEMNIFICATION. Each Service Recipient shall indemnify, reimburse, defend and hold harmless Service Provider, its Affiliates and their respective successors and permitted assigns, together with their respective current and future employees, officers, members, managers, directors, agents and representatives (collectively the “Indemnified Parties”), from and against all losses, costs, damages, injuries, taxes, penalties, interests, expenses, obligations, claims and liabilities (joint or severable) of any kind or nature whatsoever, including for injury, sickness, disease or death to employees or other persons (collectively “Losses”) that are incurred by such Indemnified Parties in connection with, relating to or arising out of (i) the breach of any term or condition of this Agreement, or (ii) the performance of any Services hereunder; provided, however, that Service Recipients shall not be obligated to indemnify, reimburse, defend or hold harmless any Indemnified Party for any Losses incurred by such Indemnified Party in connection with, relating to or arising out of:
   (a) the gross negligence, willful misconduct, bad faith or reckless disregard of such Indemnified Party in the performance of any Services hereunder; or
   (b) fraudulent or dishonest acts of such Indemnified Party with respect to the Service Recipients.
Each Service Recipient’s obligation to indemnify, defend, reimburse and hold the Indemnified Parties harmless shall extend to and include, but not be limited to, claims, demands, judgments, liabilities and expenses resulting from the personal injury, sickness, disease or death of any persons, regardless of whether such Service Recipient has paid the person under the provisions of any workers’ compensation statute or law, or other similar federal or state legislation for the protection of employees.
The rights of any Indemnified Party referred to above are in addition to any rights that such Indemnified Party otherwise has at law or in equity. Without the prior written consent of the Service Recipients, no Indemnified Party may settle, compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment in, or otherwise seek to terminate any, claim, action, proceeding or investigation in respect of which indemnification could be sought hereunder unless (A) such Indemnified Party indemnifies the Service Recipients from any liabilities arising out of such claim, action, proceeding or investigation, (B) such settlement, compromise or consent includes an unconditional release of the Service Recipients and Indemnified Party from all liability arising out of such claim, action, proceeding or investigation and (C) the parties involved agree that the terms of such settlement, compromise or consent remain confidential. In the event that indemnification is provided for under any other agreements between CVR Energy or any of its Affiliates and any of the Service Recipients or any of their Affiliates, and such indemnification is for any particular Losses, then such indemnification (and any limitations thereon) as provided in such other agreement applies as to such particular Losses and will supersede and be in lieu of any indemnification that would otherwise apply to such particular Losses under this Agreement.
In the event that any indemnity provisions of this Agreement are contrary to the law governing this Agreement, then the indemnity obligations applicable hereunder will be construed to be to the fullest extent allowed by applicable law.

-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-

7. LIMITATION OF DUTIES AND LIABILITIES. The relationship of Service Provider to Service Recipient pursuant to this Agreement is as an independent contractor and nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to impose on Service Provider or its Affiliates, or on any of their respective successors and permitted assigns, or on their respective employees, officers, members, managers, directors, agents and representatives (each, a “Service Provider Party”), an express or implied fiduciary duty. No Service Provider Party shall be liable for, and Service Recipient shall not take, or permit to be taken, any action against any Service Provider Party to hold such Service Provider Party liable for, (a) any error of judgment or mistake of law or for any liability or loss suffered by Service Recipient in connection with the performance of any Services under this Agreement, except for a liability or loss resulting from gross negligence, willful misconduct, bad faith or reckless disregard in the performance of the Services, or (b) any fraudulent or dishonest acts with respect to Service Recipient. In no event, whether based on contract, indemnity, warranty, tort (including negligence), strict liability or otherwise, shall any Service Provider Party be liable for loss of profits or revenue or special, incidental, exemplary, punitive or consequential damages; provided, however, that the foregoing limitation does not preclude recourse to any insurance coverage maintained by the Parties pursuant to the requirements of this Agreement or otherwise.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Agreement shall automatically terminate as to a Party without any further action by any Party immediately prior to the time at which such Party ceases to be under common control (measured with respect to indirect equity ownership or, in the case of CVR Partners, ownership of its general partner) with the other Parties.
