Clause: 'Alamo shall use commercially reasonable efforts to maintain true and accurate records in connection with the Services provided, in sufficient detail to permit accurate verification of the compensation (including fixed fees and pass-through expenses) paid to or due Alamo.  Once annually during the Term (or more frequently for cause or if a previous audit showed any discrepancy), and for a one year period after the expiration or earlier termination of this Agreement, Client, or an independent accounting firm appointed by Client, may conduct an audit or inspection of such Alamo records, solely for the purpose of verifying either the amount of payments made hereunder or compliance with the terms set forth herein and in a Project Agreement.  Such inspections shall be made during ordinary business hours, on reasonable prior written notice, and shall be conducted so as to not interfere with the operations of Alamo’s business.  If the inspection is conducted by an independent accounting firm appointed by Client, prior to any inspection, such independent accounting firm shall execute a confidentiality agreement in a form reasonably acceptable to Alamo.  Books and records of Alamo that are not subject to inspection include: (a) individual personnel files of Alamo employees and agents; (b) any information relating to Alamo’s other clients; and (c) any of Alamo’s internal costs or non-billable expenses.  To the extent that such audit reveals any overpayments or underpayments by Client, Client shall make up the amount of shortfall or, if applicable, Alamo shall refund the amount of overpayment made by Client, within thirty (30) days from the date of Alamo’s receipt of the audit or accountant’s report.  In the event that any audit shows that Client has overpaid Alamo by five percent (5%) or more Client may immediately terminate this Agreement.'
