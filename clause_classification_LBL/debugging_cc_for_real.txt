No waiver of any provision of this Agreement will constitute a waiver of any other provision nor will any waiver of any provision of this Agreement constitute a continuing waiver unless otherwise expressly provided. A party’s failure or delay in exercising any right under this Agreement will not operate as a waiver of that right. A single or partial exercise of any right will not preclude a party from any other or further exercise of that right or the exercise of any other right.

Stripped line: ARTICLE 7

Stripped line: FEES AND EXPENSES

Stripped line: 7.1.1        BRELP hereby agrees to pay as provided by this Article 7, during the term of this Agreement, the Net Base Management Fee, quarterly in arrears.

Stripped line: 7.1.2        The amount of the Net Base Management Fee payable hereunder for any Quarter will be equal to the amount of the Base Management Fee reduced (the “Base Management Fee Adjustment”) by the following amounts, to the extent that such amounts have not previously reduced the amount of the Base Management Fee as a result of the application of the Base Management Fee Adjustment in a previous Quarter:

Stripped line: 7.1.2.1        any Service Agreement Fees paid in or payable for that Quarter; and

Stripped line: 7.1.2.2        any Creditable Operating Entity Payments paid in or payable for that Quarter.

Stripped line: 7.1.3        For greater certainty, the Base Management Fee will not be reduced by operation of this Agreement by the amount of any (i) Incentive Distribution paid or payable by any Service Recipient or Operating Entity to any member of the Brookfield Group; (ii) any fees for Operational and Other Services that are paid or payable by any Operating Entity to any member of the Brookfield Group; or (iii) any Transaction Fees.

Stripped line: In no event shall BRELP, or any of the Service Recipients, be obligated under this Agreement and the Service Agreements to pay, in the aggregate in respect of any Quarter, any amount exceeding the Base Management Fee payable for that Quarter, after giving effect to any reductions for Creditable Operating Entity Payments contemplated by Section 7.1.2.

Stripped line: For the purposes of Section 7.1.2 hereof, if a payment giving rise to a Base Management Fee Adjustment was denominated in a currency other than the U.S. dollar, the amount of such payment will be deemed to be equal to the amount in U.S. dollars into which such payment could have been converted on the last day of the relevant Quarter using the exchange rate between such other currency and the U.S. dollars published in the “Exchange Rates” table of the Wall Street Journal on such date or, in the event that the “Exchange Rates” table of the Wall Street Journal was not published on such date, the closest date immediately preceding the date of such payment on which the “Exchange Rates” table of the Wall Street Journal was published.

Stripped line: 7.4.1             The Service Providers or another member of the Service Provider Group will compute each instalment and allocation of the Net Base Management Fee (including computation of the Base Management Fee Adjustment) as soon as practicable following the end of the Quarter with respect to which such instalment is payable, but in any event no later than five Business days following the end of such Quarter. A copy of the computations and allocations made will thereafter, for informational purposes only, promptly be delivered to each Service Recipient by the relevant member of the Service Provider Group upon request. Payment of the Net Base Management Fee for any Quarter (whether in cash, Units, BRELP Units or any combination of the forgoing) shall be due and payable promptly after the 45th day following the end of such Quarter. For greater certainty, any Dispute relating to the computation of the Net Base Management Fee shall be resolved in accordance with Article 12.

Stripped line: 7.4.2             For any Quarter in which the Governing Body of the Managing General Partner determines that the BEP Group has insufficient cash (taking into account any availability under any hydrology reserve facility) to pay the Net Base Management Fee as well as the next regular distribution on Units, BRELP may elect to pay all or a portion of the Net Base Management Fee payable in such Quarter in Units or BRELP Units, provided that (i) any such election shall be made within 45 days following the end of the applicable Quarter, (ii) no such payment shall be made in Units without the written consent of BEP, and (iii) no such payment shall be made in BRELP Units without the written consent of the Service Providers. If BRELP elects to pay all or a portion of the Net Base Management Fee in Units or BRELP Units, BEP or BRELP, as applicable, shall issue, and the applicable Service Provider hereby agrees to acquire, Units or BRELP Units, as applicable, equal to the portion of the Net Base Management Fee elected to be paid in Units or BRELP Units divided by the Fair Market Value of a Unit on the date BRELP makes such election (provided that no fractional Units or BRELP Units shall be issued, and such number shall be rounded down to the nearest whole number with the remainder payable to the Service Providers in cash). In such case, BEP or BRELP, as applicable, is directed to apply such payment against the subscription price for such Units or BRELP Units, as applicable.

Stripped line: 7.4.3             If BRELP elects to pay all or any portion of the Net Base Management Fee for any Quarter in Units or BRELP Units, the Service Recipients shall take or cause to be taken all appropriate action to issue such Units or BRELP Units, as applicable, including any action required to ensure that such Units or BRELP Units, as applicable, are issued in accordance with applicable Laws and listed on any applicable stock exchanges and public quotation systems.

Stripped line: 7.5.1             The Service Providers acknowledge and agree that the Service Recipients will not be required to reimburse any member of the Service Provider Group for the salaries and other remuneration of the management, personnel or support staff who provide the Services to such Service Recipients or overhead for such persons.

Stripped line: Without limiting Section 7.5, the Service Recipients shall pay or reimburse the relevant member of the Service Provider Group for all sales taxes, use taxes, value added taxes, goods and services taxes, harmonized sales taxes, withholding taxes or other similar taxes, customs duties or other governmental charges (“Governmental Charges”) that are levied or imposed by any Governmental Authority by reason of this Agreement, any Service Agreement or any other agreement contemplated by this Agreement, or the fees or other amounts payable hereunder or thereunder, except for any income taxes, corporation taxes, capital taxes or other similar taxes payable by any member of the Service Provider Group which are personal to such member of the Service Provider Group. Any failure by the Service Provider Group to collect monies on account of these Governmental Charges shall not constitute a waiver of the right to do so.

Stripped line: From time to time the Service Providers shall, or shall cause the other members of the Service Provider Group to, prepare statements (each an “Expense Statement”) documenting the Expenses and Governmental Charges to be reimbursed pursuant to this Article 7 and shall deliver such statements to the relevant Service Recipient. All Expenses and Governmental Charges reimbursable pursuant to this Article 7 shall be reimbursed by the relevant Service Recipient no later than the date which is 30 days after receipt of an Expense Statement.

Stripped line: This Service Level Agreement (“SLA”) describes Miso’s commitment to Product availability.

Stripped line: Definitions

Stripped line: For purposes of this SLA, the following definitions shall apply:

Stripped line: “Operating Hours” means the time during which the Product is “clocked-in” for use. Miso utilizes a clock in/clock-out approach to calculate Operating Hours. A clock-in event occurs when Customer’s worker starts the Product via the user interface. Similarly, a clock-out event occurs when Customer’s worker shuts down the Product through the user interface or otherwise. The period between a clock-in event and a clock-out event shall be considered “Clocked Time”. Operating Hours for a particular month consists of the sum of all periods of Clocked Time for that month.

Stripped line: “Outage” means a critical full outage/severe issue that constitutes a catastrophic problem that causes complete inability to use the Product, resulting in production downtime and where there is no workaround or solution to the problem.

Stripped line: "Excluded" means that period of time during which the Product is unavailable or inoperable due to any of the following: (i) Force Majeure or circumstances beyond Miso’s reasonable control; (ii) Customer's combination of the Product with any hardware or software not supplied by Miso or not identified by Miso in writing as compatible with the Product; (iii) issues in Customer’s environment, network, power supply or infrastructure; (iv) telecommunications or internet service provider failures, or loss of availability due to a network attack such as DDoS, SYN or similar attacks, or issues caused by DNS resolution and/or domain name or certificate expiration; (v) regularly scheduled or emergency maintenance; or (vi) improper use, alteration, or damage of the Product.

Stripped line: "Monthly Uptime" means (total Operating Hours in calendar month – Excluded - Outage durations) / (total Operating Hours in calendar month - Excluded) X 100%.

Stripped line: Service Commitment and Remedies

Stripped line: Miso’s service commitment is to maintain a Monthly Uptime of 99.9% for the Product in a given calendar month. All availability calculations will be based on Miso’s system records. Miso will provide Customer with a Monthly Uptime Report, including reasonable supporting detail for Outages and Excluded periods, within ten (10) days of the end of each month during the Term.

Stripped line: In the event Miso fails to meet the service commitment during two (2) or more consecutive calendar months, Customer’s exclusive remedy for such downtime is to receive a credit equal to the prorated amount of Monthly Recurring Fees applicable to the downtime, which credit shall be applied against the next subsequent invoice(s) until the credit is exhausted.

Stripped line: To receive the above remedy, the failures must be reported by Customer to their Miso-appointed Robot Support Specialist or other Miso-appointed support representative within twenty (20) days of the end of the last month of the consecutive two-month period for which a credit claim is made.

Stripped line: The report submitted by Customer must identify (i) the applicable Product and Installation Site, (ii) the dates, times and duration of downtimes, and (iii) any technical support requested or remediation implemented. Before processing any credit request, Miso will validate the information provided in the request to confirm the loss of availability, its timeframe, and corresponding credit.

Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, upon sixty (60) days prior notice to Customer, Equinix may in its reasonable discretion change the rates and fees for any and all Services at any time(s) after twelve (12) months from the effective date of the applicable SOW for such Service, unless otherwise agreed to by the Parties in writing.

If Customer wishes to dispute a charge listed on an Equinix invoice to Customer (a “Disputed Amount”), Customer must submit a written dispute notice that includes reasonably sufficient supporting documentation within ninety (90) days of receipt of the initial invoice on which the Disputed Amount appears. If Customer does not submit such written dispute notice and reasonably sufficient supporting documentation to Equinix within such ninety (90) day period, then notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Customer waives all rights to dispute such Disputed Amount and to file a claim of any kind relating to such Disputed Amount (and Customer also waives all rights to otherwise claim that it does not owe such Disputed Amount or to seek any set-offs or reimbursements or other amounts of any kind based upon or relating to such Disputed Amount).

This credit is Customer’s sole and exclusive remedy for interruptions, suspensions, failures, defects, delays, impairments or inadequacies in any of the Services. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Customer will only have the right to receive a credit if (i) Customer notifies Equinix within five (5) days of its inability to use the Temporarily Unusable Licensed Space and (ii) the Temporarily Unusable Licensed Space is not usable for reasons other than for (a) the actions or omissions of Customer, Customer’s Authorized Persons, Accompanying Persons or Associated Entities; (b) Customer’s Equipment, or the equipment of any of Customer’s Authorized Persons, Accompanying Persons, or Associated Entities; or a Force Majeure Event.

In addition, Customer will notify Equinix of any non-renewal, cancellation, reduction in policy limit or other material change in Customer’s coverage at least forty-five (45) days prior to such change in coverage.

Stripped line: b. Customer will cause and ensure that each insurance policy referred to in Section 7(a), will provide that the insurers waive all claims and rights of recovery by subrogation against the Equinix Parties in connection with any liability or damage covered by Customer’s insurance policies.

Stripped line: a. This Agreement will commence on the MSA Effective Date and, unless terminated earlier in accordance with this Agreement, will terminate on the date the last Order then in effect expires or is terminated. Either Party may terminate this Agreement by giving written notice of termination to the other Party if the other Party breaches any material term or condition of this Agreement and fails to cure such breach within thirty (30) days after receipt of such notice. If the breach (other than where Customer has failed to pay Service Fees owed) cannot be cured within thirty (30) days, the breaching Party shall be given a reasonable period of time, but not to exceed sixty (60) days, to cure the breach, provided that the breaching Party acts promptly and diligently to cure such breach. Equinix may also terminate this Agreement if (i) it exercises any of its rights under Section 8(b) three (3) or more times during any twelve (12) month period; (ii) Customer’s breach referenced in Section 8(b) (ii) or (iii) continues for at least ten (10) days after Customer’s receipt of written notice from Equinix, or (iii) Customer liquidates, ceases to do business, or becomes insolvent. Notwithstanding anything in this Section 8(a) to the contrary, except where Customer has failed to timely cure a monetary breach, if Customer has Licensed Space in more than one IBX Center, and a Party fails to timely cure a material breach as to fewer than all such IBX Centers, then the non-breaching Party may only terminate the Orders for Services in the IBX Center(s) where the material breach has not been timely cured, and this Agreement and all other Orders will remain in full force and effect as to all other IBX Centers.

Stripped line: b. Equinix may suspend the provision of Services, including discontinuing the supply of power and denying access to the IBX Center, if (i) Customer fails to cure any monetary breach of this Agreement (e.g. fails to pay any amounts owed) within ten (10) days of notice of the same (or within five (5) days of notice of the same in the event Customer’s account is past due on two (2) or more occasions during a six (6) month period); (ii) Customer breaches any provision of this Agreement that in Equinix’s reasonable judgment interferes with Equinix’s operation or maintenance of the IBX Center or with one or more of its other customer’s use thereof, and Customer fails to cure such breach within one (1) hour of being notified (either by fax, e-mail or phone call, at the option of Equinix as to which form of notification) of the same; or (iii) Customer breaches any provision of this Agreement that in Equinix’s reasonable judgment has the potential to interfere with Equinix’s operation or maintenance of the IBX Center or with one or more of its other customers’ use thereof, and Customer fails to cure such breach within forty-eight (48) hours of being notified (either by fax, e-mail or phone call, at the option of Equinix as to which form of notification) of the same. If Equinix suspends a Service pursuant to this Section 8(b), unless Equinix has subsequently terminated this Agreement as permitted under this Agreement, Equinix will resume the discontinued Service within twenty-four (24) hours after it is reasonably satisfied that Customer has cured the breach (es) which gave rise to the suspension, and Equinix may charge a reinstatement fee equal to the direct out-of-pocket expenses incurred by Equinix to discontinue and to then resume the Service.

Stripped line: c. Equinix or Customer may terminate this Agreement as to any affected Licensed Space or IBX Center if any portion of the IBX Center in which the affected Licensed Space is located becomes subject to a condemnation proceeding or is condemned, Equinix’s possession is otherwise terminated or abated, or Equinix cannot provide Customer with access to the affected Licensed Space as contemplated herein for a period exceeding thirty (30) days. Customer may terminate this Agreement as to a Licensed Space if Equinix modifies the Policies in a way that materially adversely affects Customer’s use of the Services in such Licensed Space, but only if Customer provides written notification that it wishes to terminate this Agreement within thirty (30) days after Customer received notification of such changes in the Policies.

Stripped line: d. Upon expiration or termination of this Agreement, or an Order (or any portion thereof), all rights of Customer with respect to the Licensed

Stripped line: Space (or the affected portion thereof) (“Terminated Space”), will terminate, and Customer will immediately remove all of Customer’s Equipment and other tangible items of any kind belonging to Customer, Customer’s Authorized Persons, Accompanying Persons and/or Associated Entities located in such Terminated Space, but not any wiring, cable or other equipment or property owned, leased or licensed by Equinix. If Customer fails to remove any such property (including Customer’s Equipment) in accordance with this Section 8(d), Equinix will be entitled to pursue all available legal remedies against Customer, including (i) immediately removing any or all such property and storing it at Customer’s expense at an on-site or off-site location; (ii) shipping such property to the address set forth at the end of this Agreement at Customer’s risk and expense; or (iii) liquidating such property in any commercially reasonable manner and charging Customer for all costs associated with the liquidation if Equinix provides thirty (30) days’ prior notice to Customer. If Customers account is past due (excluding Disputed Amounts, subject to a pending dispute), including during the time after this Agreement or any Order or portion thereof expires or is terminated then, notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Customer may not remove any of Customer’s Equipment from an IBX Center and hereby waives its right to do so. Additionally, Equinix may (i) immediately remove any or all such property and store it at Customer’s expense at an on-site or off-site location until Customer pays all amounts owed to Equinix and then retrieves the property, or (ii) liquidate such property in any commercially reasonable manner and charge Customer for all costs associated with the liquidation and retain from the liquidation all amounts necessary to pay Equinix the past due amounts if Equinix provides thirty (30) days’ prior notice to Customer and Customer fails to pay all such amounts.

Stripped line: e. While Customer has no right to use the Services provided under an Order after the end of the term of such Order, if Customer does so, Customer will be obligated to pay for such Services pursuant to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and any such Order, and any such Order will continue in effect for as long as the Services are used by Customer. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in such event, any such Order will be terminable at will by Equinix effective immediately upon notice to Customer. In addition, notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if this Agreement would have otherwise terminated prior to Customer’s cessation of its use of the Services, this Agreement will continue in effect for as long as the Services are used by Customer, but this Agreement will be terminable at will by Equinix effective immediately upon notice to Customer.

Stripped line: f. Neither Party will be liable to the other Party for properly terminating this Agreement or any portion thereof in accordance with its terms, but Customer will be liable to Equinix for any amounts owed prior to the effective date of termination. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Equinix has the right to recover from Customer all damages recoverable under law for the period past the end of the Term, if Equinix terminates this Agreement prior to the end of the full Term due to Customer’s material breach.

Stripped line: g. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement (including in any Order) to the contrary, under no circumstances will any Order survive the expiration or earlier termination of this Agreement, and under no circumstances will any Order pertaining to an IBX Center survive the termination of this Agreement as to that IBX Center. Equinix will not have any obligation to provide any Services after the expiration or earlier termination of this Agreement, and Equinix will not have any obligation to provide any Services at an IBX Center after the expiration or earlier termination of this Agreement as to such IBX Center.

Stripped line: a. Notice. Except where otherwise expressly stated in the Agreement(e.g. 8(b) (ii) and (iii)), (and regardless of whether certain provisions in this Agreement expressly require written notice, consent or approval) all notices, consent, or approvals required by this Agreement will only be effective if in wiring and sent by (i) certified or registered air

The Parties irrevocably agree to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of San Francisco, California. If any legal action is brought by either Party arising from, or related to, the subject matter of this Agreement, the prevailing Party will be entitled to an award of its reasonable attorney’s fees and costs.

Stripped line: c. Entire Agreement. This Agreement, the exhibits, the Policies then in effect, and all Orders executed at any time during the Term, all of which are incorporated herein by reference into this Agreement, constitute the complete and entire agreement between the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof, and supersede and replace any and all prior or contemporaneous discussions, negotiations, proposals, understandings and agreements, written and oral, regarding such subject matter, as well as any industry custom.

This Agreement may be executed in two or more counterparts, each of which will be deemed an original, but all of which together will constitute one and the same instrument. This Agreement may be amended only in writing by an instrument signed by each Party. For the avoidance of doubt, the prior sentence is not meant to prohibit the Order procedure described in Section 2 or prohibit Equinix from modifying the rates and fees or the Policies pursuant to Sections 3(b) and 4(c), respectively.

Stripped line: d. Construction. Each Party acknowledges and agrees that it has reviewed, and has had an opportunity to have reviewed, this Agreement (including the exhibits and the Policies), and it is the Parties’ intent that this Agreement will not be construed against any Party. The section headings and captions throughout this Agreement are for convenience and reference only, and will not be used to construe this Agreement. If any provision of this Agreement, as applied to any Party or to any circumstance, is adjudged by a court to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, the same will not affect the validity, legality, or enforceability of the portion of the provision, if any, that is not invalid, illegal or unenforceable, the application of such provision in any other circumstances, or the validity, legality, or enforceability of any other provision of this Agreement. All terms and conditions of this Agreement will be deemed enforceable to the fullest extent permissible under applicable law, and, when necessary, the court in any action between the Parties is requested to reform any and all terms or conditions to give them as much effect as possible.

Stripped line: e. Survival. Sections 4(b), 5, 6, 8, 9(d), (e), (h), (i), Exhibit A, and Section (g) of Exhibit B will survive the termination of this Agreement, but Exhibit A will only survive for one (1) year after the end of the Term. In addition, all provisions of this Agreement that can only be given proper effect if they survive the termination of this Agreement will survive the termination of this Agreement. This Agreement will be valid as to any obligation incurred prior to termination of this Agreement, including any Service Fees owed by Customer.

Stripped line: PURCHASE AND SUPPLY AGREEMENT

Stripped line: This Purchase and Supply Agreement (“Agreement”) dated as of [●] is entered into by and between [Buyer Name] (“Buyer”), a company having its registered office at [●], and [Seller Name] (“Seller”), a company having its registered office at [●] and a wholly-owned subsidiary of [Parent Company Name], a company having its registered office at [●] (“Parent”).

Stripped line: RECITALS

Stripped line: WHEREAS, Buyer, through its [●] division, is a developer and supplier of ultra linear, high-performance radio amplifiers for the wireless infrastructure market;

Stripped line: WHEREAS, Seller is a newly formed entity that intends to be a developer and supplier of high-performance radio frequency power semiconductors and integrated modules for the wireless infrastructure market;

Stripped line: WHEREAS, Buyer, Parent and Seller have entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement, dated [●] (the “Asset Purchase Agreement”), pursuant to which, among other things, Seller shall purchase Buyer’s [●] business division; and

Stripped line: WHEREAS, following the purchase of Buyer’s [●] business division, Seller wishes to supply Buyer with high-performance radio frequency power semiconductors and integrated modules and related components and systems (collectively, “Components”) and Buyer wishes to acquire such Components from Seller.

Stripped line: NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual promises contained in this Agreement and intending to be legally bound, Buyer and Seller agree:

Stripped line: ARTICLE I.

Stripped line: TERM, QUANTITY, QUALITY, PRICING AND PAYMENT

Stripped line: Section 1.1 Term. The term of this Agreement shall commence on [●] (the “Effective Date”) and shall end at the conclusion of the [●] month period following the Effective Date (the “Term.”).

Stripped line: Section 1.2 Minimum Commitment. In each calendar quarter during the Term, Buyer agrees to purchase and accept delivery from Seller of, and Seller agrees to sell and ship to Buyer, Components having an aggregate purchase price not less than the respective minimum commitment amounts set forth below:

Stripped line: (for each calendar quarter, and as it may be reduced or modified by the terms hereof, the “Minimum Commitment”). The Minimum Commitment shall be satisfied by Buyer Purchases; provided, however, that, to the extent that Buyer Purchases in a calendar quarter exceed the Minimum Commitment for that calendar quarter, such excess shall not carry over to be applied against the Minimum Commitment for any subsequent calendar quarter. As used herein, “Buyer Purchases” means the aggregate amount the purchase price (without giving effect to the Shortfall Surcharge (defined below)) of purchases of Components from Seller and other of the Parent’s products that are shipped by Seller to Buyer during a given calendar quarter or that have Original Delivery Dates (as defined in Section 3.1) or scheduled delivery dates otherwise mutually agreed upon in writing, in each case within such calendar quarter if not shipped during that calendar quarter. For purposes of this Section 1.2, Buyer Purchases include purchase of Components from Seller by any subsidiary of Buyer in which Buyer owns over 50% or by an entity which controls Buyer (owns 50% or greater ownership in Buyer); provided, however, that purchases by any of the entities specified in Schedule 1.2 hereto shall not be included as Buyer Purchases.

Stripped line: If Buyer fails to satisfy the Minimum Commitment for any calendar quarter, Buyer shall pay to Seller in cash, within [●] days following such calendar quarter, an amount equal to the Shortfall Surcharge. As used herein, “Shortfall Surcharge” for any calendar quarter means the difference between the (a) Adjusted Minimum Commitment (defined as Minimum Commitment less (i) Performance and Component Availability Adjustments and (ii) Guaranteed Supply Adjustments) for such calendar quarter and (b) Buyer Purchases for such calendar quarter. Buyer agrees to promptly notify Seller in the event Buyer expects to not achieve its Minimum Commitment in any period. In the event that a Shortfall Surcharge shall be payable with respect to any calendar quarter, the amount of the Shortfall Surcharge shall be deemed to have been allocated pro rata among all Components shipped during such calendar quarter as an increase in the purchase price thereof.

Stripped line: Section 1.3 Guaranteed Capacity. Seller agrees that it will allocate sufficient production capacity to Buyer to meet [●] of the Minimum Commitment, subject to the other provisions of this Agreement, including the provisions of Section 2.4 regarding lead times.

Stripped line: Section 1.4 Performance and Component Availability. (a) Buyer will provide Seller with quarterly product roadmaps and specifications for future Buyer products. Buyer will consider in good faith utilizing Components from Seller in products under development by Buyer provided that such Components are Competitive. Buyer and Seller shall in good faith discuss, and mutually agree in writing from time to time, upon the requirements for Components to be deemed “Competitive”. The requirements will be based upon whether such products (i) have key performance parameter limits that are within the key performance parameter limits for a third party component that Buyer might otherwise utilize, (ii) meet the specification requirements of Buyer’s product design, (iii) have been fully released to manufacturing by Seller, (iv) are to be projected to be available in quantities necessary to support the projected Buyer production requirements and (v) have a competitive price. The parties agree that the Components listed on Schedule 1.4 hereto are deemed to be Competitive in the Buyer products for which they currently are utilized as of the date hereof. Seller shall be afforded a period of [●]  months from the date that production parts are commercially available (or, if later, from the date the parties have mutually agreed upon the requirements for a Component to be Competitive) in which to develop and release such Competitive products to manufacturing.

Stripped line: (b) In the event that Buyer determines to “lock in” a Component in its design of Buyer products, it shall give written notice to Seller of its determination with respect to such Component (a “Locked in Component”). Thereafter, subject to the other provisions of this Agreement, if Locked In Components are not available from Seller that meet the Competitive requirements, and if other Components from the Seller portfolio are not available which would otherwise meet Buyer’s Competitive requirements for the Minimum Commitment, then the rupee volume of these Components which are purchased by Buyer from other vendors in a calendar quarter shall be deemed to be a “Performance and Product Availability Adjustment” for purposes of the Minimum Commitment for such quarter.

Stripped line: Section 1.5 Guaranteed Supply. Subject to the other provisions of this Agreement, Seller shall assure supply to Buyer of all Components that have been designed into Buyer’s products. In the event that Seller decides to discontinue manufacturing and delivery of certain Components (“End-of-Life”), Seller will accept all purchase orders provided by Buyer (“Last Time Buy”) of the specific part number(s) subject to Seller’s End of Life notification for a period of [●] months from the date of notification and Seller agrees that delivery will not exceed [●] months from the date of such notification. Buyer’s Last Time Buy must be placed before the expiration of the [●] month period following the End-of-Life notification. All Last Time Buy purchase orders shall be placed on a non-cancellable and non-refundable basis and marked as such on Buyer’s purchase orders. The price for finished Components purchased under a Last Time Buy will be subject to the prices or pricing criteria, as outlined in Section 1.6.

Stripped line: Buyer will make reasonable efforts to assess its Last Time Buy requirements for each product being subject to an End-of-Life notification and place an order for such requirement. In addition, Buyer may request that a portion of the Life Time Buy be in the form of Qualified Die Bank. “Qualified Die Bank” is defined as die in wafer form which has been subjected to the wafer fabrication process and has had a sample of [●] die across the wafer selected and then packaged and tested for those specific [●] die to confirm that the wafer will yield good RF performance devices at an economic yield. The approval by Seller of such a Buyer request for a portion of its Last Time Buy in the form of Qualified Die Bank will not be unreasonably withheld. Buyer shall purchase the Qualified Die Bank under provisions of the Last Time Buy stated above, and will bear the risk for die yield. The price for Qualified Die Bank will be no greater than the lower of (i) market price and (ii) [●] of Seller’s standard manufacturing cost (which shall include a reasonable manufacturing overhead allocation).

Stripped line: In the event that Seller is unable to satisfy Buyer’s Last Time Buy or Qualified Die Bank request for bipolar technology Components which have been designed into Buyer products prior to the Effective Date, Seller agrees to transfer a royalty free license of the manufacturing process (including packaging technology, unless Seller agrees to provide such services to Buyer to complete the Qualified Die Bank at a reasonable cost) to such End-of-Life bipolar Components to Buyer (or a designee approved by Seller, such approval not to be unreasonably withheld) to be manufactured exclusively for Buyer and be for Buyer’s own use, in order to ensure that the supply of such devices to Buyer remains uninterrupted. The technical information to support such transfer will be provided at cost so as to ensure that there is no interruption in supply and in no event later than [●] months after the End of Life notification.

Stripped line: In the event that Buyer purchases Components subsequent to an End-of-Life notification from another vendor by virtue of the fact that Seller could not deliver Components to Buyer under Buyer’s Last Time Buy purchase orders, then the purchases of such Components from another vendor other than Seller shall be deemed to be a “Guaranteed Supply Adjustment” for purposes of the Minimum Commitment.

Stripped line: Notwithstanding the foregoing, Seller agrees to not End of Life any Components during the [●] month period following the Effective Date except as disclosed on Schedule 1.5.

Stripped line: Section 1.6 Qualified Die Bank Purchases. From time to time, Buyer may request that Seller provide it with Qualified Die Bank without regard to the Life Time Buy provisions above. The approval by Seller of such a Buyer request will not be unreasonably withheld, but Buyer shall bear the risk for die yield. The price for such Qualified Die Bank shall be [●] of Seller’s standard manufacturing cost (which shall include a reasonable manufacturing overhead allocation). Any such purchase of Qualified Die Bank shall be credited against the Minimum Commitment for the quarter in which such purchase is made. Such Qualified Die Bank may be held by Buyer and thereafter submitted to Seller for Component finishing, in which case the price of the Component shall be the difference between the Component price determined pursuant to Section 1.7 and the price previously paid for such Qualified Die Bank. The differential in price shall be credited against the Minimum Commitment for the quarter in which such Component is shipped. Any Qualified Die Bank purchased by Buyer hereunder may not be sold or transferred to any party other than Seller.

Stripped line: Section 1.7 Prices. (a) The prices for products purchased by Buyer will be as set forth on Appendix A hereto, with the pricing determined as of the date of the Buyer purchase order based upon the date of shipment from Seller. For shipments of bipolar products after the quarter ending [●] the price for each bipolar product shall be the price set forth in the column for such quarter unless there shall have occurred a significant increase in packaging costs, in which case the parties shall negotiate in good faith the price for bipolar products having such increased packaging costs. For shipments of LDMOS products after the quarter ending [●] the parties shall negotiate in good faith, not less than [●] days prior to the start of a calendar quarter, the price for LDMOS products to be shipped during such calendar quarter. The parties agree to negotiate in good faith (i) changes to the LDMOS prices set forth in Appendix A from time to time in the future and (ii) prices for new Components, in each case based to ensure best available commercial price at a similar volume purchase discount and a cost per watt benchmark for substantially equivalent products of any leading competitor where specific comparable price is not available. In the event that Seller elects not to meet the best available commercial price for a particular product having equivalent specifications to the Seller Component, where such price is offered in writing to Buyer for quantities not less than those Buyer would otherwise purchase from Seller under this Agreement, and Seller has had at least [●] days after its receipt of a copy of the third party offer in which to meet such price, Buyer may purchase such product from a third-party vendor at such lower price, in which case such purchase will be credited against the Minimum Commitment.

Stripped line: Notwithstanding the foregoing, Seller shall provide Buyer with its “most favoured customers” pricing with respect all of Buyer’s Component purchases (without regard to volume or mix) for all purchase orders placed during the [●]  consecutive [●] month periods following the Effective Date, with the “most favoured customer pricing” determined at the time Buyer submits its purchase order.

Stripped line: (b) The Component prices do not include sales, use, consumption or excise taxes of any taxing authority. The amount of such taxes, if any, will be added to the Component prices in effect at the time of shipment thereof and shall be reflected in the invoices submitted to Buyer by Seller pursuant to this Agreement. Buyer shall pay the amount of such taxes to Seller in accordance with the payment provisions of this Agreement.

Stripped line: Section 1.8 Payment. Buyer shall pay Seller the applicable price for the Components that Seller ships to Buyer hereunder within [●] days from the date of the invoice therefor. All payments due to Seller under this Agreement shall be made in Indian Rupees by Buyer by wire transfer to an account to be designated in writing by Seller from time to time. All amounts not paid when due shall bear interest at the rate of [●] percent ([●]%) per month (or such other percentage, if lower, as shall not exceed the maximum rate permitted by law) commencing [●] days from the date of the relevant invoice. Buyer shall be responsible for reasonable attorneys’ fees and any other reasonable expenses incurred by Seller in connection with the collection of any amounts due and payable hereunder.

Stripped line: ARTICLE II.

Firm Orders shall include a delivery date determined in accordance with Section 2.4 hereof. The Firm Orders shall be binding on both parties, and Buyer shall be obligated to purchase and Seller shall be obligated to supply Components in the quantities indicated therein. Firm Orders may not be cancelled or modified by either party without the written consent of the other party.

Buyer may cancel any Custom Component order during the period ending on the date (the “Trigger Date”) that is the later to occur of (i) [●] days prior to the anticipated delivery date determined in accordance with Section 2.4 hereof and (ii) a date mutually agreed to by Buyer and Seller. In such event, Buyer shall be obligated to reimburse Seller for any packaging costs incurred by Seller with respect to such cancelled order (plus any restocking or similar penalty of any third-party supplier). The amount of such reimbursement shall not be credited against the Minimum Commitment.

Stripped line: Section 2.4 Lead Times. Not later than ten (10) days prior to the end of each calendar quarter, Seller will publish and provide to Buyer the lead times for delivery of Standard Components. For Standard Components, the lead time shall be [●] from the date that Buyer shall submit a purchase order for such Standard Components to Seller; provided, however, that Seller in good faith may modify the lead time for a particular Component if (i) the amount of such Component ordered is more than [●]% of the amount of such Component ordered by Buyer within the preceding [●] month period and (ii) such Components had been fully released to manufacturing prior to the commencement of such [●] month period; and provided, further, that for Components that had not been so released, a reasonable lead time shall be established (and notice thereof provided to Buyer) at the time such Components are released to manufacturing. For Custom Components, the lead time shall be [●] or such other time as may be mutually agreed in writing by the parties. Seller from time to time in good faith may modify the lead times for Components by giving written notice to Buyer base on changes in Seller’s vendors’ lead times and Seller’s capacity (subject to the minimum capacity provisions above), except that the lead time in effect as of the date of the purchase order may not be modified without the consent of the parties. Seller shall not be obligated to accept purchase orders for Components requesting deliveries outside the lead time applicable under this Section 2.4.

Stripped line: Available Services and additional terms and conditions applicable to each such Service are outlined in the Exhibits to this Agreement. Statement(s) of Work and/or Exhibits (“SOW”) will set forth the Services to be provided by EVERSANA to Client and the fees to be paid by Client to EVERSANA in connection therewith.

Stripped line: 2.1       Fees and Expenses.

Stripped line: 2.4       Disputed Fees. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Client disputes any charges or amounts on any invoice, and such dispute cannot be resolved promptly through good faith discussions between Client and EVERSANA, then Client will pay the amount of the invoice less the disputed amount, provided that Client shall diligently proceed to work with EVERSANA to resolve any such disputed amount. Any sums withheld pursuant to this paragraph shall not accrue service charges, but if the contested invoice is later determined to be valid in amount, Client shall pay the amount withheld.

Stripped line: 2.5       Effect of Failure to Pay. In the event that any invoice, other than the amount of any disputed charges or amounts reflected on such invoice, is not timely paid as provided herein, EVERSANA may, in addition to any other right or remedy that it may have under this Agreement or at law, suspend Client’s use of any Services provided hereunder or under any SOW if EVERSANA has not received payment in full within [***] days of EVERSANA’s written demand for payment of the undisputed amount of such invoice.

Stripped line: The initial term of this Agreement begins on the Effective Date and shall continue for a period of one (1) years (“Initial Term”).

Stripped line: (90) days of the date of such filing or appointment;

Stripped line: 3.5       Effect of Termination.

If payments attributable to Services performed before the termination or expiration remain unpaid upon the termination or expiration of the Agreement, Client shall make such payments promptly after the termination or expiration of this Agreement. In the event of termination, EVERSANA will use reasonable efforts to terminate work being performed by firms outside of EVERSANA (e.g. subcontracted resources) and other related commitments entered into by EVERSANA but Client will be responsible for all costs incurred by EVERSANA from such other firms and such other commitments approved by Client that could not be terminated. Client will be responsible for all EVERSANA time and expenses for Services performed up to date of termination. Upon the termination or expiration of this Agreement or any SOW, EVERSANA shall provide reasonable transition services, for a period not to exceed [***] days, as requested by the Client to facilitate the orderly transfer of Services to Client or another services provider.

In such event, the noticing party shall be temporarily relieved of its obligations during the period of such event to the extent such event prevents its performance. If the Force Majeure event continues for one or more related periods of at least sixty (60) days, the other party shall have the unilateral right to terminate this Agreement by fourteen (14) days prior written notice.

The Receiving Party shall not use, or permit the use of, any Confidential Information, without the prior consent of the Disclosing Party, for any purpose other than in connection with the proper performance of the Receiving Party’s obligations under this Agreement. The Receiving Party shall use its best efforts to prevent any inadvertent disclosure or unauthorized reproduction or use of the Confidential Information.

The Receiving Party will immediately advise the Disclosing Party in writing if the Receiving Party becomes aware of any misappropriation or misuse by any person of the Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information.

Stripped line: (b)The term “Confidential Information” does not include any data or information which the receiving Party can establish is already known to the receiving Party at the time it was initially disclosed to the receiving Party.

Stripped line: The rights of any Indemnified Party referred to above are in addition to any rights that such Indemnified Party otherwise has at law or in equity. Without the prior written consent of the Service Recipients, no Indemnified Party may settle, compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment in, or otherwise seek to terminate any, claim, action, proceeding or investigation in respect of which indemnification could be sought hereunder unless (A) such Indemnified Party indemnifies the Service Recipients from any liabilities arising out of such claim, action, proceeding or investigation, (B) such settlement, compromise or consent includes an unconditional release of the Service Recipients and Indemnified Party from all liability arising out of such claim, action, proceeding or investigation and (C) the parties involved agree that the terms of such settlement, compromise or consent remain confidential. In the event that indemnification is provided for under any other agreements between CVR Energy or any of its Affiliates and any of the Service Recipients or any of their Affiliates, and such indemnification is for any particular Losses, then such indemnification (and any limitations thereon) as provided in such other agreement applies as to such particular Losses and will supersede and be in lieu of any indemnification that would otherwise apply to such particular Losses under this Agreement.

Stripped line: In the event that any indemnity provisions of this Agreement are contrary to the law governing this Agreement, then the indemnity obligations applicable hereunder will be construed to be to the fullest extent allowed by applicable law.

Notwithstanding anything contained herein, all payments in respect of undisputed portions of each invoice and undisputed invoices shall be payable by Customer within thirty (30) calendar days of its receipt of each respective invoice.

Stripped line: Customer may set off, as a credit against any monthly charges payable to Provider under this Agreement, any SLA Credits owed to Customer pursuant to any SOW, any mutually agreed amounts to be paid, reimbursed, credited or otherwise owed or owing to Customer by Provider under this Agreement and any amounts that are determined to be owed to Customer in accordance with Section 24.3; provided that with respect to fees or services already paid by Customer that Customer later disputes, Customer must set off such amounts within ninety (90) days after payment of such disputed fees or services.

Stripped line: Provider agrees to defend, indemnify and hold harmless Customer and its Affiliates, and all of their respective officers, directors, agents, employees, successors and permitted assigns from and against any and all third party suits, proceedings, claims, liabilities, losses, actions, judgments, fines, penalties (including without limitation, civil monetary penalties, interest and similar financial obligations levied against Customer for violations of regulatory requirements), refund obligations, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees) of any kind or nature (each a “Claim” and collectively, the “Claims”), to the extent they arise out of or result from:

Stripped line: Customer agrees to defend, indemnify and hold harmless Provider and its Affiliates, and all of their respective officers, directors, agents and employees from and against any and all third-party Claims, to the extent they arise out of or result from:

Stripped line: Each Party (in the capacity as Indemnifying Party) will defend, indemnify and hold harmless the other Party, its Affiliates and all of their respective officers, directors, agents and employees (in the capacity of Indemnified Party) from and against any and all Claims relating to or based on

Stripped line: any personal injury, death or damage to property caused by the negligence or willful misconduct of the Indemnifying Party or its agents and representatives, the performance of this Agreement.

Stripped line: The Party seeking indemnification under Sections 18.1, 18.2 or 18.3 above, as the case may be (the “Indemnified Party”), will give prompt written notice to the other Party (the “Indemnifying Party”) of a Claim that is subject to such indemnification. (The failure by an Indemnified Party to give notice as provided above shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its obligation under this Section, except to the extent that such failure results in material adverse affect to the Indemnifying Party). In addition, the Indemnified Party will allow the Indemnifying Party to direct the defense and settlement of any such Claim, with counsel of the Indemnifying Party’s choosing subject to the Indemnified Party’s reasonable approval, so long as such defense is pursued diligently, and will provide the Indemnifying Party, at the Indemnifying Party’s expense, with information and assistance that is reasonably necessary for the defense and settlement of the Claim; provided, however, that the Indemnifying Party shall not admit fault in any settlement or settle any claim other than for money without the Indemnified Party’s prior written consent. The Indemnified Party shall have the right to employ separate counsel and to participate in (but not control) any such action.

Stripped line: Each Party will, at its own expense, maintain insurance policies that cover the Party’s activities under this Agreement and the activities of the Party’s employees, agents and representatives, including, but not limited to, workmen compensation insurance (wherever applicable) and comprehensive general liability and errors and omissions liability. Upon the request of the other Party, the Party to which the request is made shall cause its insurer(s) or insurance broker to provide the requesting Party with a certificate of insurance evidencing such coverages. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Provider shall carry such insurance as provided in Schedule 19.1 hereto.

Stripped line: Except for each Party’s indemnification obligations under Section 18 above, and Claims arising out of or related to a Party’s gross negligence, willful misconduct, or breach of obligations with respect to Confidential Information, in no event shall either Party’s total cumulative liability under this Agreement, whether based on breach of contract, tort (including negligence) or otherwise, exceed the *; provided, however, that in the event that a Claim arises during the * after the Effective Date, then the maximum aggregate amount of such Party’s liability shall be equal to the total amount of payments projected to be made by Customer under this Agreement during the * after the Effective Date. Provider and Customer further acknowledge and agree that they are entering in to this Agreement on the understanding that the fees for the Services to be provided under this Agreement have been set to reflect the fact that the liability and remedies shall be limited as expressly set forth in this Agreement.

Stripped line: Except for each Party’s indemnification obligations under Section 18 above, neither Party shall be liable to the other for any indirect, incidental, punitive, special or consequential loss, damage, cost or expense including, without limitation, loss of profits, loss of data, and loss of revenues, of any kind whatsoever and however caused, whether arising under contract, tort (including negligence or breach of statutory duty) or otherwise, even if that Party has been advised of its possibility. For the avoidance of doubt, the Parties agree that any damages resulting from a Party’s failure to fulfill its obligations in accordance with this Agreement in the form of fines, penalties refund obligations and other financial costs levied or imposed on Customer as a result of Provider’s failure to perform the Services in accordance with the requirements of this Agreement shall be considered direct damages and shall not be considered consequential damages.

Stripped line: Except to the extent provided in this Agreement, no Party shall be liable for any default or delay in the performance of its obligations under this Agreement (i) if and to the extent such default or delay is caused, directly or indirectly, by acts of terrorism, fire, flood, earthquake, elements of nature or acts of God, riots, civil disorders, or any other such similar cause beyond the reasonable control of such Party, and (ii) provided the non-performing Party is without fault in causing such default or delay, and such default or delay could not have been prevented by reasonable precautions and could not reasonably be circumvented by the non-performing Party through the use of alternate sources, workaround plans or other means (including with respect to Provider, by Provider meeting its obligations for performing disaster recovery services as described in this Agreement). Any such event or occurrence as described in this Section 21.1 shall be deemed a “Force Majeure Event.”

Stripped line: Upon notification to the other Party of the occurrence of a Force Majeure Event, the non-performing Party, except to the extent provided in this Agreement, shall be excused from further performance or observance of the obligations so affected for as long as such circumstances prevail and such Party continues to use commercially reasonable efforts to recommence performance or observance without delay. Any Party so delayed in its performance shall immediately notify the Party to whom performance is due by telephone (to be confirmed in writing within twenty-four (24) hours of the inception of such delay) and describe at a reasonable level of detail the circumstances causing such delay.

Stripped line: Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, Provider agrees that no Force Majeure Event that affects Provider’s performance hereunder shall relieve Provider from its obligations for a period of more than three (3) days from the date on which Provider notifies or should have notified Customer of a Force Majeure Event. After the elapse of such period, all SLAs and other covenants applicable to Provider’s performance under this Agreement or any SOW shall again be in full force and effect. In addition, if any Force Majeure Event substantially prevents, hinders or

Stripped line: delays Provider’s performance of the Services such that it substantially interferes with Customer’s business for more than twenty four (24) hours, then Provider shall immediately shift its provision of the Services from the affected Facility to a Disaster Recovery Site described in Section 8 above (if Provider has not done so already). If the Force Majeure Event continues for more than three (3) consecutive days and Provider’s performance falls below the Catastrophic Failure Service threshold with respect to a Service, which for this purpose shall be no lower than 80% of the baseline Service Level specified in an applicable SOW (as supplemented by the SSIO thereto) with respect to any Service, then Customer may, at its option and without violation of the volume obligations under such SOW, procure such Service from an alternate source, and Provider shall be liable for payment for such Service from the alternate source, less any amounts that Customer did not pay to Provider as the result of Services not being rendered, for the lesser of (i) the period of time in which Provider’s performance remains so impaired, and (ii) thirty (30) days. Finally, effective beginning seven (7) days after Provider’s notification of the Force Majeure Event, in the event Provider’s performance remains below the Catastrophic Failure Service threshold with respect to a Service, which for this purpose shall be no lower than 80% of the baseline Service Level specified in an applicable SOW (as supplemented by the SSIO thereto) with respect to any Service, Customer may (x) terminate any portion of this Agreement so affected in whole or in part without penalty or fee, and the charges payable hereunder shall be equitably adjusted to reflect those terminated Services; or (y) terminate this Agreement in whole without liability to Provider, as of a date specified by Customer in a written notice of termination to Provider. Subject to the preceding sentence, Provider shall not have the right to any additional payments from Customer for costs or expenses incurred by Provider as a result of any Force Majeure Event. For the avoidance of doubt, the Parties agree the foregoing rights of Customer shall be in addition to and not in lieu of any other remedies available to Customer hereunder or under law or equity.

Stripped line: In addition to Customer’s rights set forth in this Section 21, the following conditions shall apply to Provider’s response to a Force Majeure Event:

Stripped line: Provider shall be deemed to have committed a “Provider Performance Default” if:

Stripped line: In the event of any termination in part by Customer, as provided in this Agreement, the charges payable under this Agreement for Services will be equitably adjusted to reflect those Services that are terminated. Upon termination of any or all Services under any SOW or this Agreement, Provider will be owed payment for Services completed up until the date of termination notice expiration, subject to any set-offs in accordance with Section 15.7 above.

Stripped line: Customer shall have the option, but not the obligation, to terminate this Agreement in its entirety (including all SOWs) if Provider: (a) becomes insolvent or is unable to meet its debts or obligations; (b) files a voluntary petition in bankruptcy; (c) has an involuntary petition in bankruptcy filed against it that is not challenged within fifteen (15) days and dismissed within thirty (30) days; (d) is adjudicated a bankrupt; (e) has a receiver or trustee appointed for its assets; (f) makes a general assignment for the benefit of creditors; (g) has any significant portion of its assets attached.

Stripped line: If Provider (or its ultimate parent entity) is subject to a “Change of Control” (as such term is defined below), Provider shall notify Customer thereof no later than ten (10) days after the Change of Control takes place.

Stripped line: Due to the impact any termination of this Agreement would have on Customer’s business, Customer’s failure to perform its responsibilities set forth in this Agreement shall not be deemed to be grounds for termination by Provider. Provider acknowledges that Customer would not be willing to enter into this Agreement without assurance that it may not be terminated by Provider and that Provider may not suspend performance except, and only to the extent, pursuant to Section 15.5 or Section 22.1.2. Provider’s nonperformance of its obligations under this Agreement shall be excused if and to the extent (a) such Provider nonperformance results directly from a Relief Event comprised of Customer’s failure to perform its responsibilities; and (b) Provider provides Customer with reasonable notice of such nonperformance and (if requested by Customer) uses commercially reasonable efforts to perform, notwithstanding Customer’s failure (with Customer reimbursing Provider for its out-of-pocket expenses for such efforts).

Stripped line: Except as may be required in connection with any post-expiration or post-termination provision of the Services, upon the expiration or termination of this Agreement for any reason, (i) all licenses and other rights granted to Customer or Provider hereunder will terminate and become null and void, (ii) all materials, including without limitation, Confidential Information, provided by either Party to the other hereunder will be returned within thirty (30) days after the effective date of expiration or termination or shall be destroyed if so requested by the disclosing Party, and (iii) all earned and unpaid fees and expenses will become immediately due and payable.

Stripped line: Termination of this Agreement or any SOW hereunder (howsoever occasioned) shall not affect the any accrued rights or liabilities of either Party nor shall it affect the coming in to force or the continuance in force of any position hereof which is expressly or by implication intended to come into or continue in force on or after such termination. In addition, in the event of a termination of a SOW, such termination shall not affect the obligations of the Parties under other SOWS. For the avoidance of doubt, in accordance with Section 26.19 below, all clauses, which by their nature ought or intend to survive the expiration or termination of this Agreement, shall continue to so survive or operate following the expiration or termination of the Agreement.

Stripped line: Any dispute relating to the interpretation of, arising out of, relating to or in connection with this Agreement or any SOW, including any question regarding its existence, validity or termination

Stripped line: (a “Dispute”), will be referred in the first instance to the JSC for resolution, which will in good faith attempt to resolve a Dispute within *.

Stripped line: If a Dispute is not resolved as per Level 1 above, then it shall be referred to the Governance Board for resolution which will in good faith attempt to resolve the Dispute within a further *.

Stripped line: Each Party agrees to continue performing its obligations under this Agreement while a Dispute is being resolved, except to the extent the issue in dispute precludes performance (it being agreed that a Dispute over payment shall not be deemed to preclude performance) and without limiting either Party’s right to terminate this Agreement as provided in Section 22.

Stripped line: In recognition and acknowledgement of the fact that (i) Provider currently lacks experience and knowledge in providing services to the home healthcare industry in the United States, (ii) Customer will be providing substantial training and imparting Customer and industry-specific information to Provider and the Provider Personnel during the Term hereof as well as investing considerable resources in outsourcing the Services to Provider, and (iii) Provider and the Provider Personnel will benefit tremendously from receiving such training and infusion of information and Customer’s investment, Provider hereby agrees and undertakes that during the *, unless otherwise agreed by Customer, Provider shall not, and shall cause the Provider Personnel not to: (1) render services to or otherwise assist or support any Competitor; or (2) or carry on or engage directly or indirectly, whether through partnership or as a shareholder, joint venture partner, collaborator, consultant, employee, or agent or in any other manner whatsoever, whether for profit or otherwise, any business undertaken by any Competitor.

Stripped line: In addition, Provider shall take all legally permissible steps to subject the Provider Personnel, including, without limitation, those persons occupying Key Provider Positions, to the same restrictions. Provider shall, within thirty (30) days of execution of this Agreement, provide copies of letters signed by each of the Provider Personnel occupying Key Provider Positions agreeing to be bound by the provisions of this Section 25 and specifically stating that in the event

Stripped line: the Provider Personnel commits a breach of the provisions hereof, then a significant proportion of his or her annual remuneration that has been, is being or will be withheld by Provider will be forfeited.

Stripped line: This Agreement and all matters and Disputes relating to it shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware (excluding its conflict of laws statutes and principles) and applicable United States federal law.

Stripped line: The relationship between Provider and Customer is that of independent contractors.

Stripped line: If at any time any clause or part of this Agreement, is found by any court, tribunal or administrative body of competent jurisdiction to be wholly or partly illegal, invalid or unenforceable in any respect, such provision will be deemed restated, in accordance with applicable law, to reflect as nearly as possible the original intention of the parties, and the remainder of the Agreement will continue in full force and effect.

Stripped line: This Agreement shall be binding on the Parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns. Provider may not assign this Agreement without the prior written consent of Customer, which consent Customer may withhold or condition in its sole and absolute discretion. Any assignment by operation of law, order of any court, or pursuant to any plan of merger, consolidation or liquidation, shall be deemed an assignment for which prior written consent is required. Any assignment made without Customer’s consent as required above shall be null and void and of no effect as between the Parties.

Stripped line: Each Party acknowledges that the terms and conditions of this Agreement (including any perceived ambiguity herein) shall not be construed in favor of or against any Party by reason of the extent to which any Party or its professional advisors participated in the preparation of the original or any further drafts of this Agreement, as each Party has been represented by counsel in its negotiation of this agreement and it represents their mutual efforts.

Stripped line: All media releases, public announcements and public disclosures by either Party relating to this Agreement or the subject matter of this Agreement, including promotional or marketing material, but not including announcements intended solely for internal distribution or disclosures to the extent required to meet legal or regulatory requirements beyond the reasonable control of the disclosing Party, shall be coordinated with and approved by the other Party prior to release. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Provider may list Customer as a customer and describe in general terms the services provided by Provider under this Agreement in proposals and other marketing materials.

Stripped line: This Agreement is intended for the sole and exclusive benefit of the signatories and is not intended to benefit any third party. Only the Parties to this Agreement may enforce it.

Stripped line: This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, each of which shall constitute an original and all of which shall constitute one agreement.

Stripped line: Except where expressly provided as being in the discretion of a Party, where approval, acceptance, consent or similar action by either Party is required under this Agreement, such action shall not be unreasonably delayed or withheld. An approval or consent given by a Party under this Agreement shall not relieve the other Party from responsibility for complying with the requirements of this Agreement, nor shall it be construed as a waiver of any rights under this Agreement, except as and to the extent otherwise expressly provided in such approval or consent.

Stripped line: Each Party shall, at the request of the other Party, perform those actions, including executing additional documents and instruments, reasonably necessary to give full effect to the terms of this Agreement.
