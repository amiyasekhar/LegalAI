Stripped line: A.Background Checks. Provider will pre-screen all Services personnel by conducting background checks. The background checks will include: (i) inquiry regarding past criminal convictions (covering all localities in which the candidate has lived or worked in the past seven years) and will be based on candidate social security numbers (or international equivalent); (ii) verification that the Services personnel are under no contractual or other restrictions that would prohibit or impair the ability of such personnel to perform the Services for zulily; and (iii) verification that performance of the Services by the personnel will not violate any federal or state law, statute or regulation of the jurisdiction in which such Services personnel may be providing the Services. Provider will obtain and maintain written results of all criminal background checks. Provider agrees that Services personnel who will have access to zulily Facilities will be thoroughly screened for convictions; individuals with theft and violence felony convictions may be excluded from providing Services, regardless of when the conviction occurred. In assessing any other potential Services personnel with a conviction, Provider will assess: (a) the nature and gravity of the offense or conduct, including the harm caused, the specific elements of the crime, and whether it was a felony or misdemeanor; (b) the time that has passed since the offense or conduct and/or completion of the sentence; and (c) the nature of the job held or sought.

If any Services personnel are placed at the Facility before performance of background checks and/or drug testing required by zulily, zulily shall not be liable for any fees under Section 3 hereof for any such employees subsequently terminated due to a failed background check and/or drug test unless mutually agreed to by the Parties in advance.

Stripped line: 

Stripped line: Child 113 (p):

Stripped line: Customer may terminate this Agreement, in whole or in part as to any SOW or portion thereof, for convenience and without cause at any time by giving Provider at least * prior written notice designating the termination date (the “Termination for Convenience Effective Date”), in which event this Agreement or the relevant SOW (or portion thereof) shall terminate as if the date so specified were the originally scheduled date of termination. In the event that a purported termination for cause by Customer under Section 22.1 is determined by a competent authority not to be properly a termination for cause, then such termination by Customer shall be deemed to be a termination for convenience with adequate prior notice under this Section 3.3. In the event of a termination by Customer for convenience pursuant to this Section 3.3, then Customer shall pay to Provider a termination fee, for each SOW or portion thereof so terminated under Section 3.3, determined as follows (the “Termination for Convenience Fee”):

Stripped line: 3.3.2The number of * for which the Termination for Convenience Fee described in Section 3.3.1 above shall be payable shall decrease by * and on each successive * of the relevant SS Commencement Date after a Termination for Convenience Effective Date takes place. For example, if a Customer-designated Termination for Convenience Effective Date takes place between the * of the relevant SS Commencement Date, then the Termination for Convenience Fee shall be equal to the amount of fees Customer paid or became obligated to pay to Provider for the Terminated Services under the Agreement during the * immediately preceding the applicable Termination for Convenience Effective Date, and, if the Termination for Convenience Effective Date takes place between the * of the relevant SS Commencement Date, then the Termination for Convenience Fee shall be equal to the amount of fees Customer paid or became obligated to pay to Provider for the Terminated Services under the Agreement during the * immediately preceding the Termination for Convenience Effective Date, with the * reductions to continue in a like manner, except that in no event shall the Termination for Convenience Fee be less than * fees paid or payable by Customer to Provider, irrespective of the Termination for Convenience Effective Date.

Stripped line: 3.3.3In the event of a De Facto Termination for Convenience (as such term is defined below) by Customer, Customer shall pay a Termination for Convenience Fee based on when the Termination for Convenience Effective Date takes place as provided in Sections 3.3.1 through 3.3.2 above only for the average * shortfall of those Services or category of Services under a given SOW that are considered to have suffered a De Facto Termination for Convenience (i.e., the volume of Services terminated beyond the * threshold described below). For purposes of this Section 3.3.3, a “De Facto Termination for Convenience” means a sustained decrease over each of * following the SS Commencement Date in the volume of one or more Services under a given SOW for which Customer is obligated to pay (based on the number of transactions available for Provider to perform) that is greater than * of the * average of the same over the * immediately preceding the period of decreased volume. For example, if the * average volume of transactions during months * following the * of the relevant SS Commencement Date is * transactions and the volume of transactions that Customer makes available to Provider to perform during months * is *, respectively, then Customer shall be deemed to have committed a De Facto Termination for Convenience for exceeding the * variance threshold of * transactions (* % of *) for * and shall be obligated to pay Provider a Termination for Convenience Fee equal to * worth of fees associated with the average * shortfall of * transactions. Notwithstanding the foregoing, under no circumstances shall Customer be deemed to have committed a De Facto Termination for Convenience if Provider is otherwise able to redeploy the Provider Personnel who would otherwise have been idled by the shortfall in volume of Services required to perform other Services on behalf of Customer. In addition, for purposes of clarification and to avoid any misunderstanding, any portion of a Service for which Customer is obligated to pay (even if such Service

For purposes of this Section 3.3.4, a “Major Increase” means a sustained increase in the volume of a Service demanded by Customer after the relevant SS Commencement Date during each of * that is greater than * of the * average over the * immediately preceding the period of increased volume, which increase requires Provider to incur additional capital costs and/or enter into additional binding commitments in order to meet Customer’s demands that, in aggregate, exceed by more than * the pre-existing costs or commitments incurred by Provider immediately prior to Customer’s demand for such Major Increase.

Failure of Customer to provide any such assistance or resources specified in the applicable SOW will not constitute a breach by Customer or Customer Default but will merely be a Relief Event to the extent, and only for so long as, such failure persists and actually causes Provider to be unable or impairs Provider’s ability to provide the affected Services. Provider shall be obligated to perform any Services which are unaffected by such failure on the part of Customer, and Provider shall continue to provide even affected Services to the maximum extent that it is feasible to do so. Any resources not specifically identified in a SOW as Customer’s responsibility to obtain or provide shall be deemed to be Provider’s responsibility.
