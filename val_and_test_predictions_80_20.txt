Clause #185
Clause Text:
In an effort to resolve informally and amicably any dispute or controversy which might arise between the parties with respect to this Agreement, without first resorting to any third party or tribunal for resolution, the parties shall first endeavor to resolve the matter through direct discussions and negotiations. If the matter cannot be settled, it shall be referred by each party to a responsible officer of each Alcoa and Camargo Corrêa. If the two officers are unable to resolve the matter within 30 days of its referral, the matter will be referred to the Chief Executive Officers of Alcoa and Camargo Corrêa. If settlement is not thereafter reached through their efforts within an additional 30 days, or such longer time period as they may agree, then either party may initiate arbitration proceedings to resolve the matter. Any such dispute, controversy or claim in connection with this Agreement, including its validity, interpretation, application, scope, enforceability, performance, breach and termination, shall be resolved exclusively and finally by arbitration, to the exclusion of the courts. Notice of arbitration shall be deemed proper if made in accordance with Section 7.6 of this Agreement. If the parties fail to agree in writing on the place where the arbitration is to be conducted, such arbitration shall be held in New York, New York, United States of America. Arbitration shall be conducted in English, pursuant to International Chamber of Commerce (“ICC”) Arbitration Rules in force at the time of the arbitration, by a panel of three arbitrators who are fluent in the English language and who are skilled in the legal and business aspects of the subject matter of this Agreement. The arbitrators shall be appointed in accordance with ICC Rules. Any monetary award made pursuant to such arbitration shall be calculated and paid exclusively in Dollars. Judgment upon the award rendered may be entered in any court having jurisdiction, or an application may be made to any court for a judicial acceptance of the award and an order of enforcement, as the case may be. Each of the parties hereby irrevocably and unconditionally submits, for itself and its property, to the nonexclusive jurisdiction of any Federal court of the United States of America sitting in New York City and any appellate court from thereof for recognition or enforcement of any such judgment. Each party hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives any objection (including any defense of inconvenient forum) which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of such venue, and each party irrevocably consents to service of process in the manner provided for notices in Section 7.6.

Clause #186
Clause Text:
For any dispute or claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement, or breach hereof, either Buyer or Seller may demand arbitration of the matter unless the amount of the Loss is at issue in pending litigation with a third Person, in which event arbitration shall not be commenced until such amount is ascertained or both Parties agree to arbitration in accordance with this Section. Any arbitration initiated pursuant to this Section shall be conducted by three arbitrators. Buyer and Seller shall each select one arbitrator, and the two arbitrators so selected shall select a third arbitrator, each of which arbitrators shall be independent. The arbitrators shall set a limited time period and establish procedures designed to reduce the cost and time for discovery while allowing the Parties an opportunity, adequate in the sole judgment of the arbitrators, to discover relevant information from the opposing Parties about the subject matter of the dispute. The arbitrators shall rule upon motions to compel or limit discovery and shall have the authority to impose sanctions, including attorneys fees and costs, to the same extent as a court of competent law or equity, should the arbitrators determine that discovery was sought without substantial justification or that discovery was refused or objected to without substantial justification. The decision of a majority of the three arbitrators as to the validity and amount of any claim in a Claim Notice shall be binding and conclusive upon the Parties to this Agreement. Such decision shall be written and shall be supported by written findings of fact and conclusions which shall set forth the award, judgment, decree or order awarded by the arbitrators. Judgment upon any award rendered by the arbitrators may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. Any such arbitration shall be held in Santa Clara County, California under the rules then in effect of the American Arbitration Association. In any arbitration conducted pursuant to this Section, each Party shall pay its own expenses, and the fees of each arbitrator shall be paid one-half by Seller and one-half by Buyer.

Clause Text:
Promptly after receipt by either party hereto seeking indemnification pursuant to Section 7.2 (an "Indemnified Party") of written notice of any investigation, claim, proceeding or other action in respect of which indemnification is being sought (each, a "Claim"), the Indemnified Party promptly shall notify the party against whom indemnification pursuant to Section 7.2 is being sought (the "Indemnifying Party") of the commencement thereof; but the omission to so notify the Indemnifying Party shall not relieve it from any liability that it otherwise may have to the Indemnified Party, except to the extent that the Indemnifying Party is materially prejudiced and forfeits substantive rights and defenses by reason of such failure. In connection with any Claim as to which both the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party are parties, the Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to assume the defense thereof. Notwithstanding the assumption of the defense of any Claim by the Indemnifying Party, the Indemnified Party shall have the right to employ separate legal counsel and to participate in the defense of such Claim, and the Indemnifying Party shall bear the reasonable fees, out-of-pocket costs and expenses of such separate legal counsel to the Indemnified Party if (and only if): (x) the Indemnifying Party shall have agreed to pay such fees, out-of-pocket costs and expenses, (y) the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party reasonably shall have concluded that representation of the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party by the same legal counsel would not be appropriate due to actual or, as reasonably determined by legal counsel to the Indemnified Party, potentially differing interests between such parties in the conduct of the defense of such Claim, or if there may be legal defenses available to the Indemnified Party that are in addition to or disparate from those available to the Indemnifying Party, or (z) the Indemnifying Party shall have failed to employ legal counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party within a reasonable period of time after notice of the commencement of such Claim. If the Indemnified Party employs separate legal counsel in circumstances other than as described in clauses (x), (y) or (z) above, the fees, costs and expenses of such legal counsel shall be borne exclusively by the Indemnified Party. Except as provided above, the Indemnifying Party shall not, in connection with any Claim in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one firm of legal counsel for the Indemnified Party (together with appropriate local counsel). The Indemnifying Party shall not, without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party (which consent shall not unreasonably be withheld), settle or compromise any Claim or consent to the entry of any judgment that does not include an unconditional release of the Indemnified Party from all liabilities with respect to such Claim or judgment.

Clause Text:
If Owners request verification of Contractor’s Costs claimed by Contractor [***] or for any Work performed or provided on a Time and Materials Basis, Owners or Owners’ independent auditor shall examine and audit Contractor’s records and books related to those costs and provide a report to Owners. Owners’ audit right also shall apply to Contractor’s books and records that pertain to any Change Order or to [***]. Such audit will be conducted during business hours and provide each Owner with a reasonable opportunity to verify that all costs and charges have been properly invoiced in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. Owners shall not be entitled to audit any information that would enable Owners to determine the make-up of any lump sum, or any fixed or established amounts, rates or multipliers permitted under this Agreement [***]; provided, however that Owners shall be permitted such information for the limited purposes of determining [***]. If an audit by the auditor reveals charges to or paid by Owners as charges or fees which are incorrectly charged, then Owners shall be entitled upon demand for a refund from Contractor of such plus interest since the date of payment of the over-charges at a rate equal to the Prime Rate plus one percent (1%). Likewise, if an audit or if an examination by any state or local taxing agency reveals additional Sales Tax to be imposed upon Contractor for under collection of tax from Owners on a taxable sale, then Contractor shall be entitled, upon demand, for a refund from Owners of all such amounts actually paid, subject to the following proviso: Contractor acknowledges and agrees that Owners will remit any and all Sales Tax due to the State of Georgia or any taxing jurisdiction thereof directly to the Georgia Department of Revenue (“DOR”) pursuant to a “Direct Pay Permit” issued to Owners by the DOR, which Owners shall also provide to Contractor, thereby relieving Contractor of any obligation to collect and remit such Sales Tax in Georgia. In the event that the DOR or any other Georgia taxing authority attempts to collect Sales Tax from Contractor with respect to any taxable sale to Owners, Contractor shall notify Owners of same and Owners shall provide to Contractor and the Georgia taxing jurisdiction evidence of payment of such Sales Tax pursuant to the Direct Pay Permit. Should such taxing jurisdiction continue to pursue the collection of such Sales Tax from Contractor notwithstanding the receipt of evidence from Owners that such Sales Tax has been paid, Owners shall have right, but not the obligation, to contest Contractor’s liability for such Sales Tax on Contractor’s behalf in any administrative or judicial proceedings that may arise with respect thereto. Notwithstanding anything in this Section to the contrary, Owners shall not be restricted from any audit rights that they are required to have in order to comply with applicable Laws, including without limitation the requirements of the NRC.

Clause #185
Clause Text:
In an effort to resolve informally and amicably any dispute or controversy which might arise between the parties with respect to this Agreement, without first resorting to any third party or tribunal for resolution, the parties shall first endeavor to resolve the matter through direct discussions and negotiations. If the matter cannot be settled, it shall be referred by each party to a responsible officer of each Alcoa and Camargo Corrêa. If the two officers are unable to resolve the matter within 30 days of its referral, the matter will be referred to the Chief Executive Officers of Alcoa and Camargo Corrêa. If settlement is not thereafter reached through their efforts within an additional 30 days, or such longer time period as they may agree, then either party may initiate arbitration proceedings to resolve the matter. Any such dispute, controversy or claim in connection with this Agreement, including its validity, interpretation, application, scope, enforceability, performance, breach and termination, shall be resolved exclusively and finally by arbitration, to the exclusion of the courts. Notice of arbitration shall be deemed proper if made in accordance with Section 7.6 of this Agreement. If the parties fail to agree in writing on the place where the arbitration is to be conducted, such arbitration shall be held in New York, New York, United States of America. Arbitration shall be conducted in English, pursuant to International Chamber of Commerce (“ICC”) Arbitration Rules in force at the time of the arbitration, by a panel of three arbitrators who are fluent in the English language and who are skilled in the legal and business aspects of the subject matter of this Agreement. The arbitrators shall be appointed in accordance with ICC Rules. Any monetary award made pursuant to such arbitration shall be calculated and paid exclusively in Dollars. Judgment upon the award rendered may be entered in any court having jurisdiction, or an application may be made to any court for a judicial acceptance of the award and an order of enforcement, as the case may be. Each of the parties hereby irrevocably and unconditionally submits, for itself and its property, to the nonexclusive jurisdiction of any Federal court of the United States of America sitting in New York City and any appellate court from thereof for recognition or enforcement of any such judgment. Each party hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives any objection (including any defense of inconvenient forum) which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of such venue, and each party irrevocably consents to service of process in the manner provided for notices in Section 7.6.

Clause #186
Clause Text:
For any dispute or claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement, or breach hereof, either Buyer or Seller may demand arbitration of the matter unless the amount of the Loss is at issue in pending litigation with a third Person, in which event arbitration shall not be commenced until such amount is ascertained or both Parties agree to arbitration in accordance with this Section. Any arbitration initiated pursuant to this Section shall be conducted by three arbitrators. Buyer and Seller shall each select one arbitrator, and the two arbitrators so selected shall select a third arbitrator, each of which arbitrators shall be independent. The arbitrators shall set a limited time period and establish procedures designed to reduce the cost and time for discovery while allowing the Parties an opportunity, adequate in the sole judgment of the arbitrators, to discover relevant information from the opposing Parties about the subject matter of the dispute. The arbitrators shall rule upon motions to compel or limit discovery and shall have the authority to impose sanctions, including attorneys fees and costs, to the same extent as a court of competent law or equity, should the arbitrators determine that discovery was sought without substantial justification or that discovery was refused or objected to without substantial justification. The decision of a majority of the three arbitrators as to the validity and amount of any claim in a Claim Notice shall be binding and conclusive upon the Parties to this Agreement. Such decision shall be written and shall be supported by written findings of fact and conclusions which shall set forth the award, judgment, decree or order awarded by the arbitrators. Judgment upon any award rendered by the arbitrators may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. Any such arbitration shall be held in Santa Clara County, California under the rules then in effect of the American Arbitration Association. In any arbitration conducted pursuant to this Section, each Party shall pay its own expenses, and the fees of each arbitrator shall be paid one-half by Seller and one-half by Buyer.

Clause Text:
Promptly after receipt by either party hereto seeking indemnification pursuant to Section 7.2 (an "Indemnified Party") of written notice of any investigation, claim, proceeding or other action in respect of which indemnification is being sought (each, a "Claim"), the Indemnified Party promptly shall notify the party against whom indemnification pursuant to Section 7.2 is being sought (the "Indemnifying Party") of the commencement thereof; but the omission to so notify the Indemnifying Party shall not relieve it from any liability that it otherwise may have to the Indemnified Party, except to the extent that the Indemnifying Party is materially prejudiced and forfeits substantive rights and defenses by reason of such failure. In connection with any Claim as to which both the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party are parties, the Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to assume the defense thereof. Notwithstanding the assumption of the defense of any Claim by the Indemnifying Party, the Indemnified Party shall have the right to employ separate legal counsel and to participate in the defense of such Claim, and the Indemnifying Party shall bear the reasonable fees, out-of-pocket costs and expenses of such separate legal counsel to the Indemnified Party if (and only if): (x) the Indemnifying Party shall have agreed to pay such fees, out-of-pocket costs and expenses, (y) the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party reasonably shall have concluded that representation of the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party by the same legal counsel would not be appropriate due to actual or, as reasonably determined by legal counsel to the Indemnified Party, potentially differing interests between such parties in the conduct of the defense of such Claim, or if there may be legal defenses available to the Indemnified Party that are in addition to or disparate from those available to the Indemnifying Party, or (z) the Indemnifying Party shall have failed to employ legal counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party within a reasonable period of time after notice of the commencement of such Claim. If the Indemnified Party employs separate legal counsel in circumstances other than as described in clauses (x), (y) or (z) above, the fees, costs and expenses of such legal counsel shall be borne exclusively by the Indemnified Party. Except as provided above, the Indemnifying Party shall not, in connection with any Claim in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one firm of legal counsel for the Indemnified Party (together with appropriate local counsel). The Indemnifying Party shall not, without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party (which consent shall not unreasonably be withheld), settle or compromise any Claim or consent to the entry of any judgment that does not include an unconditional release of the Indemnified Party from all liabilities with respect to such Claim or judgment.

Clause Text:
If Owners request verification of Contractor’s Costs claimed by Contractor [***] or for any Work performed or provided on a Time and Materials Basis, Owners or Owners’ independent auditor shall examine and audit Contractor’s records and books related to those costs and provide a report to Owners. Owners’ audit right also shall apply to Contractor’s books and records that pertain to any Change Order or to [***]. Such audit will be conducted during business hours and provide each Owner with a reasonable opportunity to verify that all costs and charges have been properly invoiced in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. Owners shall not be entitled to audit any information that would enable Owners to determine the make-up of any lump sum, or any fixed or established amounts, rates or multipliers permitted under this Agreement [***]; provided, however that Owners shall be permitted such information for the limited purposes of determining [***]. If an audit by the auditor reveals charges to or paid by Owners as charges or fees which are incorrectly charged, then Owners shall be entitled upon demand for a refund from Contractor of such plus interest since the date of payment of the over-charges at a rate equal to the Prime Rate plus one percent (1%). Likewise, if an audit or if an examination by any state or local taxing agency reveals additional Sales Tax to be imposed upon Contractor for under collection of tax from Owners on a taxable sale, then Contractor shall be entitled, upon demand, for a refund from Owners of all such amounts actually paid, subject to the following proviso: Contractor acknowledges and agrees that Owners will remit any and all Sales Tax due to the State of Georgia or any taxing jurisdiction thereof directly to the Georgia Department of Revenue (“DOR”) pursuant to a “Direct Pay Permit” issued to Owners by the DOR, which Owners shall also provide to Contractor, thereby relieving Contractor of any obligation to collect and remit such Sales Tax in Georgia. In the event that the DOR or any other Georgia taxing authority attempts to collect Sales Tax from Contractor with respect to any taxable sale to Owners, Contractor shall notify Owners of same and Owners shall provide to Contractor and the Georgia taxing jurisdiction evidence of payment of such Sales Tax pursuant to the Direct Pay Permit. Should such taxing jurisdiction continue to pursue the collection of such Sales Tax from Contractor notwithstanding the receipt of evidence from Owners that such Sales Tax has been paid, Owners shall have right, but not the obligation, to contest Contractor’s liability for such Sales Tax on Contractor’s behalf in any administrative or judicial proceedings that may arise with respect thereto. Notwithstanding anything in this Section to the contrary, Owners shall not be restricted from any audit rights that they are required to have in order to comply with applicable Laws, including without limitation the requirements of the NRC.
